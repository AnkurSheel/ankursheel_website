Tauranga is New Zealand's fifth-largest city has been a popular lifestyle location. There are quite a few things to do
here over a weekend including several waterfalls, walks, cruises and watersports.

We start with a 3 km walk to take in a selection of heritage sites. Some of the highlights below

From the Elms Mission house, we reach the Robbins Park which house the 28 bed rose garden which has recently been
nominated as one of the best in New Zealand.

Next was the Marshalls Animal Park. I did not find much to do here. However, it's a nice place to visit if you have kids
and want them to get acquainted with farm and wild animals.

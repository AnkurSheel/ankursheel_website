Every couple of weeks, there is a contest hosted by the folks at [codingame.com](http://www.codingame.com). This time
around it was a multiplayer AI bot competition based on the Bomberman theme.

If you just want to look at my statistics for this contest, you can just scroll to the bottom but, then you would miss
seeing all the things I did wrong. ðŸ˜Š

## Preamble

The game was turn based, where each turn consisted of you reading the world state information from _stdin_ and
outputting your action to _stdout_. This would be repeated till either only 1 bot was alive or a fixed number of rounds
had passed. If there was more than 1 bot alive at the end, the winner would be decided by the number of boxes that they
had blown up. You also had a maximum of 100 ms to submit your action before you would timeout and die.

There are multiple leagues:

-   Wood 3
-   Wood 2
-   Wood 1
-   Bronze
-   Silver
-   Gold
-   Legendary

To pass each league, you need to beat the boss of that league. Everyone starts from Wood 3 and depending on how good
their bot fares, they move to the higher leagues. Also, as you move to the higher leagues, extra rules might apply. For
example, in wood 3 bombs did not hurt you and the goal was to blow up more boxes than your enemy. But, by the time you
reached the bronze level, you could die from your own bombs and the main goal was to stay alive. Needless to say, this
tripped up a lot of players who got stuck in bronze as the naive implementations were not good enough to go through.

There are multiple languages that you can use to submit your bot but for obvious reasons C++ was what I went for.

## What Went Right

-   I had already spent a few days working on the puzzles at codingame which gave me a good idea of how the platform
    works. Working with web IDE (especially with C++)is a bit clunky but on the forums, I found a google chrome plugin
    that allowed my to sync a local file to the web IDE. This allowed me to work in Visual Studio which made for a much
    faster workflow.

-   I also realized that one major limitation of codingame is that the whole solution has to be one file. Since , this
    is a major hindrance for readability and debugging, I created a utility in C# which ran through all the included
    files and combined them into 1 output file which was synced to the ide (using the plugin above).

-   I spent the first day setting up the framework for my Bot. This included classes to encapsulate the GameState and
    AI. This allowed me to quickly tweak my algorithms based on the new rules that were enabled as I moved through the
    leagues.

-   Since, the web IDE does not allow for any debugging except by using the stderr stream, I wrote a python script which
    would download the game data, parse it and put it into a txt file which would be consumed by my program. This
    allowed me to step through and debug the AI, when I could see that my AI was failing to win because of some bug.

-   I created a very simple algorithm to limit the amount of nodes available for pathfinding by using a variant of
    Navmeshes.

-   Continuous refactoring after each league enabled me to tackle the new league without having to deal with a
    unreadable mess in the later stages.

-   Using source control to keep track of the AI. I cannot even stress how helpful it was to go back a version or two,
    because the new logic was performing even worse than the one a few iterations before.

-   I made it to the Silver League, which was one of the goals I had set for myself.

## What Went Wrong

-   I missed one of the rules, where the bombs were blocked by items. It was by chance that I noticed this, because my
    bot started behaving unexpectedly when only a few boxes were left on the screen. This meant that the gamestate that
    my bot was evaluating was incorrect. This led to a multitude of problems some which are outlined below.

-   I misjudged the scope of the problem and the sophistication of the other bots. My AI eventually turned to be a
    simple avoidance bot which blew up a few boxes. I think it would have been better if I had spent a little bit of
    time trying to kill other bots. In the same vein, my bot never actively tried to pick up the items to give itself
    more firepower. Most of the time it was lucky enough, that it would find a few of the items on its route.

-   I had a very basic scoring system to decide what action to perform. Unfortunately, the way I had set up the code
    meant that as the rules were enabled, it became harder to incorporate them into the scoring. I should have spent
    time refactoring so that I could easily score each move based on some heuristic and choose the best one.

-   My bot started trapping itself or moving into unsafe areas after we were able to collect items to place multiple
    bombs or to increase the range of the bombs. This took me a long time to figure out.

-   No look ahead. I did not spend any time setting up a look ahead mechanism which would have made for a more
    sophisticated bot. I assumed in the earlier stages that I would timeout with a look ahead logic. But, I should have
    added a timer to exit out before the timeout. I did add a timer eventually, but it was too late in the game

-   I did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked on this. With work and other personal commitments, I was
    only able to spend a few hours on the problem. It was also very difficult to stay motivated and write/debug more
    code after having it done for the whole day at work.

-   I was hoping to get a majority of it done over the weekend but, by then I had reached my goal of reaching the Silver
    league and could not see myself being able to get enough time to reach the Gold League. What can I say, laziness won
    the day.

-   I moved up the wood leagues before I had modified my AI to incorporate the new rules. This came to bite me in the
    ass once I reached Bronze and even more in the Silver league. In all fairness, I just resubmitted the previous bot
    with a minor tweak and the next thing I knew I had got promoted

## What would I do differently

-   Adding a more robust scoring system to decide where to move. The current scoring system just avoided tiles that were
    unsafe and tried to blow up a box. With a more sophisticated scoring system, I could have got it to easily place
    bombs where it could have achieved multiple things.

-   Adding a timer earlier on for profiling. This would have given me the confidenceÂ to add more sophisticated
    techniques without being afraid to run into time out issues.

-   Being better at deciding which feature to implement.Â By the time I reached the silver league, I had a huge scope of
    features that I wanted to implement but I got struck by paralysis analysis and I just couldn't decide which chunk
    would give me the most bang of the buck.

-   Once I realized, that I had missed the rule where items blocks bombs, I should have added it so that the bot was
    evaluating its moves on a correct game-state.

-   Make sure I incorporate the rule as they became available instead of being in a rush to move up the leagues.

-   Try to simulate the game so that I could testÂ everything locally before submitting my code.

This was the first time I got a chance to participate in a codingame contest and although I did not do as well as I
would have liked it was a lot of fun.

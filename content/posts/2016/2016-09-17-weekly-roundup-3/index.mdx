Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Can you be considered rich if you don't own a house? **FIRECracker** from **Millennial Revolution** is a millionaire who
talks about
[why she still won't buy a house](http://www.millennial-revolution.com/rent/disowned-millionaire-still-wont-buy-house/).

Should you buy things using your credit card? **Mike** at **Business Insider** tells you
[8 things you should always buy with a credit card](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/things-you-should-always-buy-with-a-credit-card-2016-8).

Have you always wondered what it takes to have a successful YouTube channel? **Ankita** from **AnkiOnTheMove** talks
about the challenges she faced (and how she overcame them) in
[growing her YouTube channel](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-started-grew-my-youtube-channel-ankita-sinha) over
the past 4 years.

What do people mean when they say the climate has changed before? **XKCD** has an
[earth temperature timeline](http://xkcd.com/1732/) which aims to answer just this question.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

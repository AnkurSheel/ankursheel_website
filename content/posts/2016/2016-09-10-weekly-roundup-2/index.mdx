Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Do you want to help out someone bad with money? **Apathy Ends** has an interesting article on
[how to tell someone that they are bad with money](http://www.apathyends.com/how-to-tell-someone-bad-with-money/). The
other article you must read while you are there is the
[7 step guide to building a financial base](http://www.apathyends.com/7-step-guide-building-financial-base/).

Budgeting is important to attain financial independence. **Pamela** from **My Money Counts** tells you
[how to implement your budget like a corporation](https://mymoneycounts.org/2016/09/06/how-to-implement-your-budget-like-a-corporation/).

Are you thinking of buying a house? Read my article about whether [you should buy or rent](/rent-buy-house). Still
convinced that buying is the right decision for you. **Jon** at **Money Smart Guides** has a
[complete guide to buying a house](http://www.moneysmartguides.com/ultimate-guide-buying-a-house).

If you have ever wondered, whether to involve your kids in trip planning or not, stop wondering. **Eric** from **Travel
Babbo** writes about his trip spanning 2 weeks across seven sites in six countries on four continents
[planned by his 10-year-old daughter](http://travelbabbo.com/2016/09/around-world-kids-two-weeks/).

Have you ever gone on a trip to get a broken bag at the carousel? **Cynthia** has
[packing tips for you from an airport baggage handler](http://www.cntraveler.com/story/packing-tips-from-an-airport-baggage-handler)
at **Cond√© Nast Traveler** to keep your bag from being destroyed.

Is there anything as a bad camera? Amadou at The WireCutter tells you why
[all cameras are good cameras](http://thewirecutter.com/blog/all-cameras-are-good-cameras/).

Do you have trouble feeling that you are living a balanced life? **Chelsea **from **The Financial Diet **follows the
[Rule of Four](http://thefinancialdiet.com/rule-four-keeps-focused-productive-fulfilled/) to make sure that she is
devoting time and energy to ensure that she constantly diversified and balanced.

Do you find working remotely hard? **Dmitry** from **Zapier** gives
[8 strategies for working remotely.](https://zapier.com/blog/productive-remote-work/)

Game Development is hard, especially if you are an indie developer. **Gianfranco** from **GBGames** pens down the
[internal struggle on doing game development right](http://gbgames.com/blog/2016/09/the-internal-struggle-on-doing-game-development-right/)
which I think is something every game developer can relate to.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

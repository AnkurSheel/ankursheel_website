For our last day during our trip to Rotorua we decided to see Wai-o-Tapu whimsically named as the Waiotapu Thermal Wonderland, a stunning geothermal area.

Our first stop was the Lady Knox Geyser, an artificial catalyzed geyser that exploded every day at 10:15 A.M. The reason it erupts at the same time everyday is because the eruption isn’t a natural phenomenon but is initiated with atleast a handful of washing powder.

The mud pools are listed on Wai-O-Tapu’s website but you can see them free of charge. Look for the Mud Pool signs off Waiotapu Loop Road and take a short drive to the car park and viewing area. The mud is active here so it’s worth the detour.

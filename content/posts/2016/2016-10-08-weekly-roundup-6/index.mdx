Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Are you an under-buyer or an over-buyer? **Ms Steward** from **How we do Money** explains why either is terrible and how to find [the sweet spot in habit spending](https://howwedomoney.wordpress.com/2016/09/29/finding-the-sweet-spot-in-habit-spending/).

It is essential to teach kids how to manage money and grow up to be financially responsible adults. **Allan** from **The Practical Saver** has the [10+ Money rules that all kids should learn](http://www.thepracticalsaver.com/10-money-rules-kids-need-learn/).

Considering that most of what we learn in school never applies to real life, is school worth it? **Steve** from **Think Save Retire** tells us why even though [school is rubbish, it kind of prepares us for real life](http://www.thinksaveretire.com/2016/10/05/school-rubbish-real-life/).

What makes a good travel blog? **Matt** from **LandLopers** pens down his thoughts on how to [distinguish between a good travel blog and one that isnâ€™t](http://landlopers.com/2016/10/03/travel-blog).

**Daniel** at the **8th Light blog** writes about What it means to be an [egoless programmer](https://8thlight.com/blog/daniel-irvine/2016/09/30/the-egoless-programmer.html) and why every programmer should strive to be one.

Can blind methods work for recruiting the best programmers? **Ivan** details his experiment on [hiring someone using the blind method](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blind-method-hiring-software-developer-ivan-boyko) on **LinkedIn.**

Piracy is rampant in the Games industry. **Pieter** has a great article on **Gamasutra** why [people in Third World Countries resort to piracy](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/PieterSmal/20161006/277370/Solving_the_problem_of_Piracy_in_the_Third_World.php)and how the companies can address these issues by using a carrot rather than a stick.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

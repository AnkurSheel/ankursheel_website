The views from the Mount Maunganui summit tends to leave one breathless. Or is it just because of the exertion of
walking along a 3.4 km steep track :) See the gallery and decide for yourself.

There are a number of cafes near the base where you can regain the calories that you burnt while climbing the mount. You
can also relax at the beach or in the hot water spa. For the campers, the Mount Maunganui Beachside Holiday Park is
really popular and it seemed to be packed when we visited the mount.

Mount Maunganui  is about a hourish drive from Rotorua and about 2-3 hours from Auckland.

Did you walk up to the Mount Maunganui summit? How did you find the view? Let me know in the comments.

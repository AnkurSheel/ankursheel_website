The views from the Mount Maunganui summit tends to leave one breathless. Or is it just because of the exertion of walking along a 3.4 km steep track :) See the gallery and decide for yourself.

There are several cafes near the base to regain the calories you burnt while climbing the mount. You can also relax at the beach or in the hot water spa. The Mount Maunganui Beachside Holiday Park is really popular for the campers, and it seemed to be packed when we visited the mount.

Mount Maunganui is about an hours drive from Rotorua and about 2-3 hours from Auckland.

Did you walk up to the Mount Maunganui summit? How did you find the view? Let me know in the comments.

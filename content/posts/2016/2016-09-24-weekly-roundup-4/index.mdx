Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Caz** from **YTravelblog** has a
[list of hacks to optimize your everyday spending](http://www.ytravelblog.com/life-hacks-living-expenses/) so that you
can save more money to spend on travel and experiences.

When you justify spending by saying "Time is Money", are you costing yourself even more time and money in the long run.
**FireCracker** from **Millennial Revolution** has a great article detailing how spending on things that don't make you
happy,
[unnecessarily increases the number of years you have to work](http://www.millennial-revolution.com/build/how-much-is-your-time-really-worth/)
to retire comfortably.

[Compound Interest is your best friend](http://www.moneysmartguides.com/compound-versus-simple-interest) when it comes
to easily generate passive income and **Jon** from **Money Smart Guides** tells you exactly why.

**Gav** on **Zen Pencils** has a new comic about a man who dedicates his life to sculpt a
[monument dedicated to his muse.](http://zenpencils.com/comic/muse/) This comic vaguely reminds me of
[Dashrath Manjhi(The Mountain Man of India)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashrath_Manjhi) who carved a path deep
through a hillock using only a hammer and chisel over 22 years.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Graham** from **Reverse The Crush** talks about why it is better to earn less, but do fulfilling work, than it is to
earn a lot, at the expense of a soul-crushing day job and why
[Money is just a tool](http://www.reversethecrush.com/%F0%9F%92%AB%E2%9C%8D%F0%9F%8F%BB%F0%9F%92%B0%F0%9F%92%BB%F0%9F%9B%A0%F0%9F%8F%9D-money-is-just-a-tool/).

Budgets are important but how do you start? **Allan** from **The Practical Saver** recommends
[Personal budget categories](http://www.thepracticalsaver.com/personal-budget-categories-start-budget/) to help you get

**Kristin** writes about some of the
[smart financial moves arenâ€™t always the best credit moves](http://twocents.lifehacker.com/good-money-habits-that-can-hurt-your-credit-1785962981)
at **Two Cents**. Although aimed at the US market, the article gives a good insight into why credit cards are not

**Caz** from **yTravelBlog** has a sponsored post on how to take a Luxury holiday for less by using the
[Travelex Luxury for Less](https://www.travelex.com/travelex-hub/travel-inspiration/luxury-for-less) aggregator.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

For anyone who has grown up listening to Elvis, visiting his house turned museum is a cant miss. Since, it was just a
small detour from our original itinerary and my mom is a big fan of Elvis, we ended up at Graceland. The sheer opulence
of the place is unbelievable. Here are some of the snapshots of _**The King's**_ palace.

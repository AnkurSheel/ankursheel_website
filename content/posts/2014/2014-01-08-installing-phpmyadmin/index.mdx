## Installing phpMyAdmin on Windows

-   Go to the phpMyAdmin Website and download the zip file

-   Unpack the downloaded file to the web server Document root.

-   _Optional:_ Rename the directory.

-   Create a copy of the file _config.sample.inc.php_ and rename it to _config.inc.php_

-   Open config.inc.php for editing and add/update the following

    -   _$cfg['Server'][$i]['user'] = 'root';_

    -   _$cfg['Server'][$i]['password'] = 'root-password'_

## Configuring the webserver for phpMyAdmin

-   Open the _httpd.conf_ file(located in the conf folder of the webserver) for editing

-   Find _DirectoryIndex_ and add _index.php_. This will look something like this

    -   _DirectoryIndex index.html index.php_

## Configuring php for phpMyAdmin

-   Open _php.ini_ (in the System Directory) for editing

-   Remove the semicolon from the line _;extension=php_mbstring.dll_

    -   If the line does not exist, add the line.

## Testing phpMyAdmin

-   Restart the server

-   Navigate to _<http://localhost:8080/phpMyAdmin/>_ on the browser.

-   You should see the phpMyAdmin login window

-   Enter the username and password in the login window.

-   You should now see the phpMyAdmin Control panel

From the Corn Palace, we now move to Yellowstone National Park. It is known for its wildlife, geothermal features and
the Old Faithful Geyser. This is one of those places that I believe should be in your itinerary. It is a beautiful place
and pictures cannot do justice (even though I have tried). If you are a planning a day trip, try to be at Old Faithful,
just before it scheduled to erupt. Even though we were unaware of the timings, we were lucky enough to reach the geyser
just a few minutes before the eruption.

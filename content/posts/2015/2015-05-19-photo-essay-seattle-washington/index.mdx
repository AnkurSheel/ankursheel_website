    Seattle, Washington. Seen from above, carpets of evergreen trees, pristine blue waters, and snowy white mountains
    surround the downtown's metallic skyscrapers, earning the city its nickname The Emerald City.

Unfortunately, they don't allow anyone to take pictures at their facility  :-(.  So you will have to make do with the
other pictures

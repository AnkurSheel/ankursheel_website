I have been using FiraCode as my font of choice in VS Code since I found about it. The use of ligatures while typing code is really useful and has been a game-changer. However, lately I have been seeing some VS code screenshots with cursive fonts in the text editor and I wanted some of that. But, I also wanted to keep the ligatures that FiraCode has already spoiled me with.

Using my googling skills, I found a few articles and it seemed the easiest way was to install a theme which has a cursive font already built in such as [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idbartosz.darkpp-italic). However, I like the flexibility of changing themes so this was not a viable option for me.

Now, that we know what we are looking to achieve, let's see how to make it happen.

## Updating VS Code's settings

My search for a font that encapsulates both ligatures and Cursive fonts led me to [Fira Code iScript](https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript) made by Ken Krocken. It combines 2 fonts - Fira Code as the regular font and Script12 as the italic font.

After installing the font on my system, I changed the editor settings to use _Fira Code iScript_ as the first option for _font family_.

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "'Fira Code iScript', 'Fira Code', Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",

```

VS Code uses the TextMate grammar syntax to define how it needs to render code. You can read more in the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide). In VS Code _settings.json_ you can override the font style for the current theme by modifying the _textMateRules_ under _editor.tokenColorCustomizations_.

```json
{
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
        "textMateRules": [
            {
                "name": "", // optional name for the block
                "scope": [], // array of Scopes to which the style should be applied to
                "settings": {
                    "fontStyle": "italic" // the font style that should be applied
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You might be wondering how to get the scope to put in the above JSON. Luckily, VS code has a command that can help us with this - **Developer: Inspect TM Scopes**. You can trigger this by using the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) after ensuring that the active cursor is on the token that you want to inspect.

The scope inspector displays the following information:

-   The current token.
-   Metadata about the token and information about its computed appearance.
-   Theme rules that apply to the token.
-   Complete scope list, with the most specific scope at the top.

The one that we will use is _scope list_. Whichever token you want to make italic, add it to the scopes in the _scopes_ array. You can see my current config for an example

## My current config

```json
{
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
        "textMateRules": [
            {
                "name": "comment",
                "scope": ["comment"],
                "settings": {
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Keyword Storage",
                "scope": ["keyword", "storage", "keyword.control"],
                "settings": {
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Entity",
                "scope": [
                    "entity.name.type.class", //class names
                    "entity.other.attribute-name",
                    "entity.name.method",
                    "entity.name.tag"
                ],
                "settings": {
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Variable",
                "scope": [
                    "variable.language",
                    "meta.paragraph.markdown",
                    "support.type.property-name.json",
                    "string.other.link.title.markdown"
                ],
                "settings": {
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Markdown",
                "scope": [
                    "meta.paragraph.markdown",
                    "string.other.link.title.markdown",
                    "markup.underline.link.markdown"
                ],
                "settings": {
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Json",
                "scope": ["support.type.property-name.json"],
                "settings": {
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

After these steps, I have both ligatures and cursive fonts in my editor.

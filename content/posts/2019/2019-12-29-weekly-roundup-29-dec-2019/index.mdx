Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Do you need the project that you are planning on using? [You Dont Need](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need.com) has alternatives to some of the more popular projects. It's my goto when I am looking at code samples and want to avoid _lodash_ or _jquery_.

Overlapping images is very popular in web design. **Briana Camp** shows [2 approaches for achieving overlapping images without content overlap](https://bricampgomez.com/blog/how-to-overlap-images-in-css/).

React Hooks are a great way to make your react code reusable. **Nathan Amick** shows how to take a simple stopwatch component and [extract the logic into hooks](https://dev.to/namick/why-you-should-be-writing-your-own-react-hooks-23an) to reuse the code to make a timer component.

Can we do better than saying “Right tool for the job”? **Shawn Wang** tells us [Why "Right Tool for Most Jobs" beats "Right Tool for the Job"](https://www.swyx.io/writing/hammers/).

Should you work at a tech giant or a startup? **Garry Tan** [outlines the pros and cons of both](https://blog.garrytan.com/working-for-microsoft-cost-me-200-dollars-million).

Tired of relying on the mouse for simple tasks in VS Code. **Waylon Walker** has a [handy set of keybindings](https://waylonwalker.com/blog/keyboard-driven-vscode/) which make vs code keyboard friendly.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

import Quote from '@codinators/gatsby-shared-library';

MDX and gatsby are great for building a blog. But, its a pain to create all the skeleton stuff every time I want to
create a new blog post.

## Steps to create a new blog post

1.  Create a new folder under _content/posts/{year}/{date-slug}/_
1.  Create a new _index.mdx_ file in the above folder.
1.  Copy the frontmatter from a template file or an existing post.
1.  Modify most of the properties for the new post.
1.  If the post has an image gallery, then
    1. create a subfolder _images_.
    1. copy a _data.json_ file from an existing folder and update it.

Heres an example of the frontmatter for this post

```yaml
```

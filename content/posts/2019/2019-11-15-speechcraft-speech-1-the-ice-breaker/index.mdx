## How did I get here... Wait where am I?

The first speech of the Toastmasters program is about introducing yourself to your peers and providing a benchmark for
your current skill level.

## The actual speech

## The written speech

In an attempt to give unusable dirt to Marcus and ensuring that everyone needs a coffee after, let's begin with our
history lesson. A long long time ago... Actually, in 30 odd years that I have been on this planet, I have lived in 10
cities and 3 countries. Including the 3 countries, I have visited 12 countries and done month-long road trips in a few
of them. It might not seem like much but this is quite uncommon in India. In the beginning, I was averaging a city a
year, but then I got married and things slowed down. In fact, while we were dating my now-wife was worried that I would
continue to change jobs and cities every year. Useless piece of trivia, I have convinced her to move to two different
cities since.

Apart from travelling, I like buildings. Oops, Buildings are great but I meant building stuff. Like most boys, I got
into computers to make video games. As luck would have it, I made video games for almost 10 years. The work-life can be
brutal, but it's great to be able to say that you are playing games during work hours for research purposes.

I was also heavily influenced by Terminator 2 and always wanted to build something like that. This led me to get my
masters and incidentally, the 2nd country I lived in. I got to help make some very cool agent simulations, virtual
humans and also go to play with some robots. However, I was so disappointed to learn that we were nowhere near building
SkyNet that I went back to building games. At some point, a game company in New Zealand decided it would be a good idea
to get me here and I thought free plane tickets, visa and accommodation. What's the worse that could happen? By the way,
that is also how you convince your wife to leave her job and family and move halfway across the world to a new country
with you. Unfortunately, that company closed down and my job search wasn't going particularly well. Figuring I had a
month before I got kicked out of the country I decided to take a long road trip. Surprisingly, I got a job offer even
though I hade broken one of their meeting room doors during the interview. Fast forward a bit and I found myself at
Pushpay where I heard about this thing called SpeechCraft

So that's the story of how I got... Wait where am I?

## Feedback

### Positive

-   _[From evaluator]_ Intriguing Title that was revealed at the end.
-   _[From evaluator]_ Use of Triads.
-   _[From evaluator]_ Clearly audible.
-   I got a few laughs.

### Negative

-   _[From evaluator]_ Spoke too fast.
-   Ran out of content. I forgot some of the points and the speech ended in less than 3 minutes (which was the minimum
    requirement).

## Action Points

### Previous Action points

Not Applicable as this was the first speech

### Action Points for Next Time

-   I need to speak slower and need to pause between sentences.
-   I need to look at both sides of the room.
-   There is no point in taking a printout. I don't look at it all.
-   I forgot a few of my points which made it a little shorter than the minimum of 3 minutes. Maybe I need to have more
    content so that even if I forget I still speak for at least 4 minutes.
-   I need to take my hands out of my pockets and from behind my back so that they are visible even before starting the
    speech.
-   I need to get rid of "Umms"
-   I need to stop touching my glasses and face.

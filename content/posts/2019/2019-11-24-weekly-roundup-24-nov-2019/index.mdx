Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

How do you get an image to visually float left into a middle of paragraph of text. **Chris Coyier** shares a handy little trick to achieve just that over at [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/float-element-in-the-middle-of-a-paragraph).

CSS Positioning can be confusing. **Joelle** goes through the [different CSS properties](https://dev.to/jojonwanderlust/day-11-digging-deeper-into-css-positioning-34b0) that you can use.

If like me you have ever wondered how to apply the _Inversion of Control_ pattern to React. **Kent Dodds** shows a few examples of [using Inversion of Control In React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/inversion-of-control).

I found this thread on Twitter by **Andrey Azimov** which shows [what the first version of websites of successful tech companies look like](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1177123221180538880.html). Its really interesting to how basic the first iteration looked.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Looking for a good colour palette to use? **Mackenzie Child** has a [list of curated colour palettes](https://www.happyhues.co/) to select from for your next project.

Do you find CSS overflow confusing? **Mạnh Đạt** has [some examples to clarify how the overflow property works](https://dev.to/datmt/understanding-overflow-in-css-pb).

[Undraw](https://undraw.co/) by **Katerina Limpitsouni** and **Aggelos Gesoulis** has a huge amount of open source SVG illustrations which are perfect for web pages.

**Sadhguru** shares a [story of why we should understand the the true purpose](https://isha.sadhguru.org/global/en/wisdom/article/blind-man-lamp-zen-story) of something that has been done in our tradition for generations and see if we still need them.

**Paul Graham** talks about the [most damaging lesson](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html) that we learnt in school that we should unlearn.

**Neal Agarwal** has a new interactive page to [scroll down the deep sea](https://neal.fun/deep-sea/).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

## xUnit 101

xUnit is a unit testing tool for the .Net framework. If you're new to testing with xUnit, I suggest reading the getting started [documentation.](https://xunit.github.io/docs/getting-started-dotnet-core.html)

xUnit allows support for both parameterless and parameterized tests. There are 3 different ways to supply data to the parameterized tests

-   **Inline Data** is good when the method parameters are constant but it gets unwieldy pretty quickly when you have a lot of test cases. It also can't be used when the data is not constant.
-   **Class Data** removes clutter from test files by moving the data to a separate class. It also allows you to pass non-constant data to the test. The downside is that you have to create a new class.
-   **Member Data** is similar to class data but uses a static property or method of a type instead of a _class_.

## Problems

All 3 of the above approaches have a shortcoming in that every time you want to add new data to test, you need a recompile. The classes/methods can also become quite large if you have a lot of data. For example, [this](https://github.com/AnkurSheel/AdventOfCode2018/blob/84f0174ce6d35bef70e45b1713d2e23272dc5a29/AdventOfCode2018.Tests/Day1/testData.json#L37-L1054) is the sample input for the puzzle in the [Advent Of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

## First Pass

Both these problems would just go away if we could load our test data from a file. Andrew Lock has a great [article](https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-custom-xunit-theory-test-dataattribute-to-load-data-from-json-files/) which shows how to create a custom attribute to load the data from a JSON file. Since this article leans heavily on his approach, I recommend reading that first.

Go on, I will wait.

Oh Good, you are back. So you might be wondering that if Andrew has already written the article, why am I writing this and more importantly why should you spend your precious time reading this?

Well. I found his solution to work very well for test cases with a small number of parameters. However, it becomes quite cumbersome to use with a large set of parameters. For the Advent of Code test input, we would have to have a lot of parameters. We could reduce the number of parameters required to just one as its just a single(albeit large) list of the same type. However, I was not able to figure out how to structure my JSON so that it could be parsed easily.

## Improvements

Let us start by creating a new generic class which takes 2 different underlying types - 1 for the Data and 1 for the Result class. This class will be used to deserialize the JSON data

```csharp
class TestObject<T1, T2>
{
	public List<T1> Data { get; set; }

	public T2 Result { get; set; }
}
```

Now, lets modify our attribute class. _For brevity, I am just showing the relevant code here. For the whole file please see [here](https://github.com/AnkurSheel/AdventOfCode2018/blob/master/AdventOfCode2018.Tests/JsonFileDataAttribute.cs)_.

```csharp
public class JsonFileDataAttribute : DataAttribute
{
	public override IEnumerable<object[]> GetData(MethodInfo testMethod)
	{
		// fileData is the raw file data
		// _dataType and _resultType are set in the constructor and are the types for the input data and the result

		var specific = typeof(TestObject<,>).MakeGenericType(_dataType, _resultType);
		var generic = typeof(List<>).MakeGenericType(specific);

		var jsonData = JObject.Parse(fileData);
		dynamic datalist = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonData, generic);
		var objectList = new List<object[]>();
		foreach (var data in datalist)
		{
			objectList.Add(new object[] {data.Data, data.Result});
		}
		return objectList;
	}
}
```

So what exactly are we doing here?

1. Use _[MakeGenericType](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.makegenerictype?f1url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fquery%2Fdev15.query%3FappId%3DDev15IDEF1%26l%3DEN-US%26k%3Dk(System.Type.MakeGenericType);k(DevLang-csharp)%26rd%3Dtrue&view=netframework-4.7.2>)_ to get the Type of _TestObject_ by substituting the generic type parameters by the actual parameters specified in the test.
2. Use _MakeGenericType_ again to get a new type which is a _List_ of the new constructed _TestObject_
3. Parse the file data as JSON
4. Deserialize the JSON data as the _genericType_ and store it in a _[dynamic](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/dynamic?f1url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fquery%2Fdev15.query%3FappId%3DDev15IDEF1%26l%3DEN-US%26k%3Dk(dynamic_CSharpKeyword)%3Bk(DevLang-csharp)%26rd%3Dtrue>)_ type. We need to use dynamic here as we dont know the types passed into _TestObject_ at compile time and they can change for each test.
5. Add all the data into a list of objects and return it

This allows us to write our tests in the following manner

```csharp
[Theory]
[JsonFileData("testData.json", "Part1", typeof(string), typeof(int))]
public void Test(List<string> data, int expectedResult)
{
	var result = TestThisMethod(data);
	Assert.Equal(expectedResult, result);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we built upon Andrew's basic implementation of a custom JSON data source to make it easier for us to work with larger sets of data as well are more complex data.

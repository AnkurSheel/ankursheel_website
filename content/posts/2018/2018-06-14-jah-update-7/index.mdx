## v 0.0.9

-   Automatic deployment to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) from [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/).

_There are still a few things I need to do before sending out the live link. However, if you would like to help me test
the product and suggest changes, contact me and I can send you the link._

## Next up

In the next update, we will be adding token authentication so we can enable testing through
[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) in the future.

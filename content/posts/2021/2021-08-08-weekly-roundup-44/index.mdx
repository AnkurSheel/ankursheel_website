Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

## [My 13-year-old has an $800 phone](https://www.thehappysaver.com/blog/my-13-year-old-has-an-800-dollar-phone)

Buying a phone is expensive, especially if you are a 13-year-old who wants an iPhone. **Ruth** shares a story about how her daughter could contribute 50% to an $800 iPhone purchase in 2 months.

<Quote
    quote="It's been a journey of many tiny lessons, many brief conversations and when necessary a firm bottom line, to build up her understanding of how money works. Her knowledge is growing in incremental steps"
    author="Ruth"
/>

This article shows how we can teach our children the habit of saving while also teaching them it's OK to spend money they have budgeted.

### Key Takeaways

-   Teach your child to save/invest a percentage of every dollar they earn.
-   For expensive purchases, agree to pay half the amount.
-   For massive targets, break them into smaller digestible chunks by using a "savings tracker".
-   Look at employment opportunities available to them, and if it needs the help of an adult, offer to help if they are willing to work.
-   For a kid, who have all their needs taken care of, it is the best time to teach them the habit of saving a percentage of their income.

## [Do I Need a Financial Advisor](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/do-you-need-a-financial-advisor/)

How do we know if we need a financial advisor? **Ramit Sethi** explains the criteria for needing a financial advisor and why most people don't need one.

<Quote
    quote="Most people don't need a financial advisor. We have such simple needs that with a little bit of time we can get an automatic personal finance infrastructure working for us"
    author="Ramit Sethi"
/>

### Key Takeaways

-   We need an advisor only if we have over $1 million in investable assets, have a complex financial situation, need a second set of eyes or a behavioural coach.
-   Get a fee-only advisor who is a fiduciary, meaning they are legally required to put our best interests first.
-   Reach out to at least 10 advisors and set up calls with 5.

## [How To Learn Stuff Quickly](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/)

It is easy to get stuck either in tutorial hell or reinvent every wheel when learning new things. **Josh Comeau** shares a few tips on how he has been able to pick up new skills quickly.

<Quote
    quote="The way I see it, skills are like wealth. The more skills I pick up, the faster they accumulate. Ideas and techniques gleaned in one domain can help in another"
    author="Josh Comeau"
/>

### Key Takeaways

-   In the beginning, focus on guided learning. Once we are comfortable with the fundamentals, we should spend more time building interesting things and seeing tutorials only when encountering new problems.
-   A tutorial fade is effective, but we are building the same things over and over. Basically, after following a tutorial, you try to repeat it without looking at the tutorial.
-   We can add additional functionality to the tutorial project.
-   We can build a similar project to the tutorial project.
-   By publishing what we learn, we can uncover gaps in our mental model.

## [When it Pays to Choose Microservices](https://blog.typeable.io/posts/2021-07-19-microservices.html)

Microservices are extremely popular, with a lot of big companies adopting them. But when is it worth switching over to microservices? **Victoriia Zaripova** outlines the pros and cons of developing a microservice-based solution.

<Quote
    quote="Like any other fancy solution, microservices aren't always beneficial. Neither do they give a plaster for all sores"
    author="Victoriia Zaripova"
/>

### Key Takeaways

-   If microservices don't solve the business tasks, this is a waste of time and money.
-   Don't use microservices for a new solution.
-   The minimum pool for one microservice is a team of six to nine persons. One team should support a maximum of two microservices.
-   Consider using a microservice when
    -   there are critical requirements for the application's resistance to loads and/or support of integration with external services
    -   the business requires significant acceleration of development.
    -   it's necessary to use a heterogeneous technology stack.
    -   different points of the application require different rates of changes in various points of the application.

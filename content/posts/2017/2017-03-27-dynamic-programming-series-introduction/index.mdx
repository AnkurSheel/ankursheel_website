Dynamic Programming is one of those techniques that every programmer should have in their toolbox. But, it is also
confusing for a lot of people. For a long time, I struggled to get a grip on how to apply Dynamic Programming to
problems. Most articles that I could find on the internet, gave the final dynamic programming solution without
actually showing the approach taken to arrive at the final solution.

In this article, I will show the benefits of using a Dynamic Programming approach to solving problems with an example.
In the end, I will show some steps you can use to find a Dynamic Programming solution. Hopefully, after reading this
article, you will find Dynamic Programming simple and intuitive.

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is an efficient method for solving specific types of complicated computational problems.
These problems are generally those that can be broken down into smaller overlapping sub-problems. It can be
characterised basically as recursion along with memoization. Memoization is the ability to save the results of specific
states to reuse later.

## Profiling

To prove that we are improving our solution, we need statistics that we can compare. I will be using
[google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) to help profile our solutions. The benchmark will look like this

```

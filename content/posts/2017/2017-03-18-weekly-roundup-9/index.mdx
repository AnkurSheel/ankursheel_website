Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

One of my favourite posts of the week was from **Mrs Bita** from **Bayalis is the Answer**. I could relate to all the [quirks of being born in a middle-class Indian family](http://www.bayalisistheanswer.com/indian-quirks/). They were the same as what I have seen while growing up.

Most people have an emergency fund but **Ty** from **Get Rich Quick'ish** asks a very important question - Whatâ€™s Your Financial Emergency Plan?. This has got me thinking and I might outline my financial emergency plan in a future post.

**FIRECracker** from **Millennial Revolution** outlines the different types of spousal personalities and how to [get them aboard the FI train](http://www.millennial-revolution.com/build/get-spouse-aboard-fi-train/).

**Fahim** gives a unique outlook on [How **NOT** to succeed in your coding interview](https://dev.to/fahimulhaq/how-not-to-succeed-in-your-45-minute-coding-interview) on **dev.to**. How many of these mistakes have you made?

On **Gamasutra**, **Shalin** posts the [3 things he has learned from each of his 5 jobs in the last 12 years](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ShalinShodhan/20170316/293823/3_things_I_learned_from_5_jobs_in_12_years.php).

**Gav** from **Zen Pencils** has a new [cartoon](http://zenpencils.com/comic/picasso/) based on Pablo Picasso's masterpiece _[Guernica](http://www.pablopicasso.org/guernica.jsp)_ which he completed in 5 weeks after a squadron of German bombers bombed the small town of Guernica.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

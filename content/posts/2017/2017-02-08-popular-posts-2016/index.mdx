It is time to see the most popular posts and pages on the blog in 2016.

## Posts

The most popular posts in this category were related to the Codingame contest. This kind of enforces the view that it is
better to write fewer articles but with more content. I think this was further helped by the fact that some of the posts
were added to the codingame forum which increased the visibility to a larger number of people who wouldn't have found
the blog otherwise . It also indicates that the sunday photos and quotes are not good when trying to generate traffic.
Apart from that the new zealand escapes seemed to have made for some good reading.

For a long time now, I have been looking for a side project to play around with. So far, I was scratching the itch by
participating in coding game contests and writing tutorials on this blog. But, I was not getting the satisfaction of
having something to show. I wasn't dabbling with new things and it is apparent that I was losing interest fast. In order
to address this, I have decided to start working on a new side project - **Codenamed JAH**

So what does **JAH** stand for? It's just an acronym for **_Job Application Helper_** - a piece of software that helps
you to track the status of your current job applications.

## Motivation

When Gameloft closed in 2016, I was out of a job and was talking to a bunch of companies and recruiters. At some point,
there were so many people I was in contact with, that I resorted to my trusty tool - Excel Spreadsheets to keep some of
my sanity. Fast forward to present day, and it seems to be a good idea to port the spreadsheet to an app.

## App Overview

The current plan is to have the app available both on web and mobile. As an MVP, it should be able to perform operations
to store the company name, application date and the current status. As time goes on, I will probably add more features
which will be outlined in future posts.

## Goals

To achieve this and to learn something new on the way, I will be using .netcore and Xamarin. For the web app, I will be
deploying to Azure, mainly because I get free credits from Vista to spend on Azure.

-   Learn .[netcore](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows) and
    [EF core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) by building a web app.

-   Learn [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) by building the mobile app.

-   Experiment with a TDD approach.

-   Learn about RESTful API. Sync data between web and mobile apps by using a common API.

-   Reuse shared logic between the mobile and web apps.

-   Deploy the web app to Azure.

-   Deploy the mobile app.

## Closing Thoughts

I will try to blog with an update on the progress. As I have already started the project, the next post will outline
what I have done so far.

Would this app be of interest to you? Would you like to help test it for me? What features would you like to see? Let me
know in the comments

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Do you know what Choice Architecture is? It's a term to describe how the way you present choices to consumers can affect their decision making. **Shawn Wang** shows [how both gyms and startups do choice architecture](https://www.swyx.io/choice-architecture/).

**David Perrel** explains his [CRIB system to give writing feedback](https://www.perell.com/tweetstorms/cribs-my-writing-feedback-formula). I feel irrespective of whether you have to give feedback to someone else, applying it to your writing and speaking will help a lot.

**Jamie Wong** shares a fun and extremely well-written story about [debugging with examples](http://jamie-wong.com/post/debugging-misadventures/) taken from some of the bugs he has seen at Figma.

An insightful read by **Kyle Gawley** about what [it is like to run a startup and how there is no one way to have a successful business](https://blog.usegravity.app/the-startup-success-delusion-that-put-me-in-hospital/). He starts his story with the experience of passing out and how that scare led him to change his life and build a successful business as a digital nomad.

It's difficult to work on side projects when you have a full-time job and a family. **Catalin Pit** gives an insight into his daily schedule and how [he balances his side projects and content creation with his full-time job](https://catalins.tech/how-do-i-balance-work-with-my-side-projects).

We generally know the risks that we take but in the end its only the tail end consequences that matter. **Morgan Housel** shares a personal story about [how his risk tolerance plunged after paying the ultimate price in a skiing accident](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/).

Our psychological default is to remember the negative stuff that happens in a day and complain. But, the truth is that for a lot of people, more positive things happen in a day than negative. **Jason Lengstorf** explains how he [reprogrammed his brain to become aware of his negativity and list the day's high points instead](https://lengstorf.com/how-to-be-positive/)

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

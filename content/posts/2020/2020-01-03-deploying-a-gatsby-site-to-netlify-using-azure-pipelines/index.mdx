Deploying a site to Netlify is super simple and has served me well so far. But, it has a few limits which resulted in my
builds failing after my site grew to its current size.

-   a 15-minute timeout limit for builds
-   the free tier has 300 free minutes in a month. In most cases this is fine, but gatsby takes a fair amount of time to
    process images and I was about to hit the limit.

## First Attempt - Cache the gatsby folders

For some time, I was able to solve the issue by using the unofficial
[gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache) plugin. The plugin uses an
[undocumented shared folder](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2018/05/17/faster-static-site-builds-part-one-process-only-what-you-need/#caching-for-the-win)
to cache the _.cache_ and _public_ folders across builds.

Unfortunately, this solution had 2 main issues

1. A clear cache and deploy site would fail.
1. Since my site is image-heavy, I started reaching close to the limit again.

## Second Attempt - Use Azure Piplelines

Azure Pipelines uses a YAML config file to build your project. We will use templates so that we can have separate
workflows for _pr_ and _release_ builds. Let's create 3 files:

1. _azure-pipelines.common.yaml_: The template file with the job to build the gatsby site and deploy to netlify.
1. _azure-pipelines.pr.yaml_: The pipeline to run for PR(Pull Request) builds.
1. _azure-pipelines.ci.yaml_: The pipeline to run for Live builds.

The reason I have separate workflows for Live and PR builds is to because I do not want PR builds to deploy to the live
site.

### Common Job to Build Gatsby Site

In _azure-pipelines.common.yaml_ we create the job to build the gatsby site.

```yaml
jobs:
    - job: Build

      pool:
          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

      steps:
          - checkout: self
            lfs: true

          - task: NodeTool@0
            displayName: 'Install Node.js'
            inputs:
                versionSpec: '10.x'

          - script: yarn install
            displayName: 'Install dependencies'

          - script: yarn build
            displayName: 'Build Gatsby'
```

We name the job as _Build_ and use the default _ubuntu-latest_ image. This is followed by a series of steps

1. **_Checkout_**: Checkout the repo and download the files from _git-lfs_.
1. **_Install Node.js_**: Install Node 10.x.
1. **_Install dependencies_**: Execute _yarn install_.
1. **_Build Gatsby_**: Execute the _yarn build_ script which calls _gatsby build_.

### Live Builds

Let's add the trigger for live builds in _azure-pipelines.ci.yaml_.

```yaml
name: 'Live'

trigger:
    batch: false
    branches:
        include:
            - master

pr: none

jobs:
    - template: azure-pipelines.common.yml
```

1. **_name_**: The name for this pipeline.
1. **_trigger_**: Conditions for running the pipeline for when a push is made.
    1. **_batch: false_**: trigger the pipeline for each commit i.e disable batching of builds.
    1. **_branches_**: Include only the _master_ branch so that the pipeline is triggered only for commits pushed to
       _master_.
1. **_pr: none_**: Disable triggering the pipeline for when a PR is opened or changes pushed to an open PR.
1. **_jobs_**: The jobs to run.
    1. **_template_**: Use the job template created in _azure-pipelines.common.yml_.

### PR(Pull Requests) Builds

I also want a build to be triggered every time a PR is made against _master_.

```yaml
name: 'PR $(System.PullRequest.PullRequestId)'

trigger:
    branches:
        exclude:
            - '*'
pr:
    autoCancel: false
    branches:
        include:
            - master

    - template: azure-pipelines.common.yml
```

1. **_name_**: The name for this pipeline.
1. **_trigger_**: Conditions for running the pipeline for when a push is made.
    1. **_branches_**: Exclude all branches so that the build is not triggered for commits on any branch including
       _master_.
1. **_pr:_**: Conditions for running the pipeline for when a PR is opened or changes pushed to an open PR.
    1. **_autoCancel_**: Additional pushes should not cancel in-progress runs.
    1. **_include_**: Include only the _master_ branch so that the pipeline is triggered only for PR's opened against
       _master_.
1. **_jobs_**: The jobs to run.
    1. **_template_**: Use the job template created in _azure-pipelines.common.yml_.

At this point, you might be wondering for having 2 separate files for pr and Live builds. This will become important in
the next section when we add the steps to deploy to netlify.

### Deploying to Netlify

In order to deploy to Netlify, we need a few variables which will be passed to the template as parameters and then
passed as flags to the netlify deploy command.

First, let's see what changes we need to make to the template _azure-pipelines.common.yml_. The updated lines are
highlighted.

```yaml{2-6,8,18-21}
parameters:
    deployScriptParams: '' # defaults for any parameters that aren't specified
    netlifySiteId: 'defaultID'
    netlifyToken: 'defaultToken'
    message: ''

jobs:
    - job: Build_And_Deploy

      pool:
          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

      steps:
          #unchanged from before

          - script: yarn build
            displayName: 'Build Gatsby'

          # prettier-ignore
          - script: yarn netlify deploy --site ${{ parameters.netlifySiteId }} --auth ${{ parameters.netlifyToken }} --message '${{ parameters.message }}' ${{ parameters.deployScriptParams }} --dir=public
            displayName: 'Deploy to Netlify'
```

1. **_parameters_** : The environment variables to pass as flags to the netlify deploy command.
    1. **_deployScriptParams_**: Any additional parameters that should be passed to the deploy command.
    1. **_netlifySiteId_**: The site ID for the netlify site.
    1. **_netlifyToken_**: The access token to authorize Azure Pipeline to deploy the build to netlify.
    1. **_message_**: The message to include in the deploy log.
1. **_Deploy to Netlify_**: The netlify deploy command which takes the siteId, token, message and deployScriptParams as
   flags. We also set the dir flag to public so that the public folder is deployed.
    1. **_# prettier-ignore_**: I have added this so that prettier does not try to break up the command into multiple
       lines.

Now we update _azure-piplelines.ci.yaml_ for the live build. The new lines are highlighted.

```yaml{2-3,7-11}
# unchanged from before
variables:
    - template: azure-pipelines.vars.yml

jobs:
    - template: azure-pipelines.common.yml
      parameters:
          deployScriptParams: '--prod'
          netlifySiteId: $(netlify.siteId)
          netlifyToken: $(netlify.token)
          message: 'Live $(Build.SourceVersion) $(Build.SourceVersionMessage)'
```

1. **_variables_**: We set a template file to get the environment variables.
1. **_parameters_**: The parameters to be passed to the job template
    1. **_deployScriptParams_**: For live builds, I pass the --prod flag which netlify to deploy the build to
       production.
    1. **_netlifySiteId_**: The site ID from environment variables.
    1. **_netlifyToken_**: The token from environment variables.
    1. **_message_**: The message is created using the commit ID and the comment of the commit.

Next _azure-piplelines.pr.yaml_ for the PR builds. The new lines are highlighted.

```yaml{2-3,7-11}
# unchanged from before
variables:
    - template: azure-pipelines.vars.yml

jobs:
    - template: azure-pipelines.common.yml
      parameters:
          netlifySiteId: $(netlify.siteId)
          netlifyToken: $(netlify.token)
          message:
              'PR $(System.PullRequest.PullRequestNumber) $(System.PullRequest.SourceBranch)
              $(Build.SourceVersionMessage)'
```

1. **_variables_**: We set a template file to get the environment variables.
1. **_parameters_**: The parameters to be passed to the job template
    1. **_netlifySiteId_**: The site ID from environment variables.
    1. **_netlifyToken_**: The token from environment variables.
    1. **_message_**: The message is created using the Pull Request Number, Source branch and the comment of the commit.

## Conclusion

By using Azure Pipelines, the netlify limits are no longer a problem. In a later post, we will see how we can add tests
and run them against the deploy url.

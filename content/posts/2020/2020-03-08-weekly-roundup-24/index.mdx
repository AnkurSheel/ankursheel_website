What's the worst that can happen when you stop paying your credit card. **Lars Lofgren** shares [what happens at the 30 days, 60 day, 90 day and 180-day intervals](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/stop-paying-credit-cards/). He also gives some tips to deal with collection agencies and other options to consider if you can't pay your debts.

Writing a technical blog post? You should consider all these points that **Chris Coyier** shares in this [thought exercise for writing a blog post about dark mode](https://css-tricks.com/lets-say-you-were-going-to-write-a-blog-post-about-dark-mode/).

Think your life has not improved over the years and its much worse than before? **Gwern Branwen** has a personal list of how her [life has improved since the '90s](https://www.gwern.net/Improvements) because of the progress we have made since then. Going through the list it so easy to see how we forget about the irritations that plagued our life just a few years ago.

Do you think that if you want to get things done, you need to create a sense of urgency? **Elisabeth Hendrickson** explains why [a sense of momentum is much more effective than a sense of urgency](http://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/).

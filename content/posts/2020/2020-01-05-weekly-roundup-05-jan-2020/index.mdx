Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Watching TV can be an expensive hobby. **Lars Lofgren** has a few options to [watch TV for free](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/watch-tv-online-free/).

Were you under the impression that JAMStack cannot be used to make dynamic websites/experiences? **Jason Lengstorf** has a few demos to show how we can [respond to user interactions, talk to third-party api's, store data and handle user authentication](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/12/dynamic-async-functionality-jamsstack-websites/).

**Florin Pop** has a [collection of app ideas which can be used to improve your coding skills](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). The projects are divided into 3 levels and each project has enough details in the form of description and user stories.

Its the time of the year when I feed is full of 2019 review posts. **Steve Schlafman** shares his [annual life review blueprint](https://medium.com/@schlaf/how-to-conduct-an-annual-life-review-that-will-catapult-you-into-the-new-year-d5aaffebac1f). There is also a [handy little template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ais6wP0HxoFfvHR9JVkf2sw2ft_EUBtb42JYOr6ObGo/edit) made by **Howard Gray**.

Someone wants to pick your brain and you want to help but your time is valuable. **Alex Hillman** shares his [system to weed out time wasters without saying no](https://stackingthebricks.com/pick-your-brain/)

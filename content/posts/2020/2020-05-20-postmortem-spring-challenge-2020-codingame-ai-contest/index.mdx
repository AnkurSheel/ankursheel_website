Every couple of weeks, there is a contest hosted by the folks at [codingame.com](http://www.codingame.com). This time it
was based on **Pacman**.

If you just want to look at my statistics for this contest, you can just scroll to the bottom but, then you would miss
seeing all the things I did wrong. ðŸ˜Š

## Preamble

For the contest, you were in command of 2 to 5 pacs on a grid and the goal was to eat more pellets without getting
killed by the end of the game. There was a fog of war and the attack mechanism was based on Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Like all other codingame contest, the game was turn-based, where each turn consisted of you reading the world state
information from _stdin_ and outputting your action to _stdout_. This would be repeated till either only 1 bot was alive
or a fixed number of rounds had passed.

You also had a maximum of 50 ms to submit your action before you would timeout and die.

There were multiple leagues

-   Wood 2
-   Wood 1
-   Bronze
-   Silver
-   Gold
-   Legend

To pass each league, you need to beat the boss of that league. Everyone starts from Wood 2 and depending on how good
their bot fares, they move to the higher leagues. Also, as you move to the higher leagues, extra rules might apply.

For this contest, I decided to use C#.

## What Went Right

-   I had already participated in a previous contest at codingame which gave me a base to start from. For other
    postmortems click [here](/tags/codingame).

-   **Tools from previous contests:**

    -   CGSync: A google chrome plugin that allowed me to sync a local file to the web IDE. This allowed me to work in
        Visual Studio which made for much faster workflow. The plugin can be found
        [here](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614/65).

    -   I had already built a utility program which allowed me to combine multiple files into a single c# file which
        codingame requires. This enabled me to split my code across different files while developing.

    -   I had a python script to help download the game data, parse it and put it into a text file which would be
        consumed by my program. This allowed me to step through and debug the AI when I could see that my AI was failing
        to win because of some bug instead of just relying on the stderr stream.

    -   I isolated the IO into a separate class and made it so that every time I was reading anything from _stdin_ it
        was outputted to the error stream.

    -   I had a few global constants which allowed me to do things like enabling/disabling logging with a single line
        change.

-   **Using C#**: It is much faster to write code in C# than C++, especially since its what I am primarily using in my
    day job.

-   **Continuous refactoring** enabled me to keep my code readable and isolated the areas that I had to work on.

-   **Using Source Control**: I cannot even stress how helpful it was to go back a version or two because the new logic
    was performing even worse than the one a few iterations before. This was especially true when I tried to switch to
    attack the opponent.

-   **Iterative development**: I was able to reach Silver just by concentrating on the movement rather than the pac
    types.

-   **Precomputing** the neighbour and visible cells in the 1st turn made it easier to calculate the move.
-   I was in the top 400 for some time.

## What went wrong

-   I did not write any tests which made it difficult to have confidence that I was not breaking things as I was
    refactoring and modifying the algorithm. There were a few times where I introduced a bug after refactoring and did
    not realise till my rank dropped and I watched a replay.

-   I did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked on this. With work and other personal commitments, I was
    only able to spend a few hours on the problem. I was also unable to work on the weekend just before the contest
    ended which dropped my rank from the early 400's to below 600 by the time I ended the contest.

-   I wanted to Livestream/record my development but I was not able to Livestream every time I worked on this. I could
    only Livestream early morning before starting work.

-   I was almost able to beat the Siver league Boss. In fact I was ranked 2 at some point in the league but I just
    couldn't get that slight improvement to move to the Gold league.

-   Quite a few times, the tweaks that I made, made my bot perform worse. This was especially true in the Silver League.

## What would I do differently

-   Since this was a game of partial information having an MCTS or even Negamax algorithm might have helped.

-   Rather than mixing the IO with the state, I should have kept 2 sepearte classes for the state and memory.

-   Precomputing all the paths in the 1st turn would have made it faster to tweak the algorithm

-   Adding a timer for profiling. Some of the tweaks I made resulted in timeouts which could have been optimized if I
    was profiling.

## Other Notes

-   This was a fun contest but the fog of war and partial information was a little annoying.

-   If you want a copy of any of my tools, let me know on
    [twitter](https://twitter.com/ankur_sheel/status/1263342317894656000) and I can make it available.

-   It would be great if once the contest has ended, links could be provided to tutorials for the various AI techniques
    that were successful.

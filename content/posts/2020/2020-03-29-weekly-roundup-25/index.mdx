Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

What does Serverless mean? Is it just a meaningless buzzword? **Burke Holland** thinks Serverless isn't a single concept but 3 concepts which can be described as [the Laws of Serverless](https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/laws-of-serverless/).

**Christian Oliff** has a [deep dive on the _inputmode_ attribute](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-inputmode/). It's a great way to instruct the browser about which keyboard to display.

The **team at Netlify** has a great post on how they [developed a shared terminology for code reviews](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/05/feedback-ladders-how-we-encode-code-reviews-at-netlify/). I was so inspired by this approach that we have started using a variation of this in our code reviews.

**Ramit Sethi** from I will teach you to be rich talks about the [5 levels of freedom](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-ladder-of-freedom/) and the changes he has made to move up the ladder of freedom.

How do you [decide when your monolithic application is no longer optimal](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/2017/03/21/cracking-monolith-forces-that-call-for-microservices.html) and you should move to a microservices architecture? **Marko Anastasov** shares the 2 classes of problems that you should run into before decomposing the monolith.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

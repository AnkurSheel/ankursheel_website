Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Tiago Forte** shares his technique of [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/) to write discoverable notes. I have just started applying it to how I consume content over the internet as well as for writing book summaries over at [Discoveries in Bookland](https://www.discoveriesinbookland.com/) and it has been a game-changer. You summarize the notes in layers whenever you come across the note rather than all at once.

A brag document is extremely helpful to remember all the small things that you did when it is time for a performance review. Instead of trying to remember everything **Julia Evans** recommends maintaining a [brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) that you can refer to. She also has a template that you can use at the end of the post.

Do you know what it takes to write a book? How about crowdfunding it and then independently publishing it? **Blake Boles** documents not only the [17-month long process of writing](https://www.blakeboles.com/2020/07/book-story/) but also what his costs were.

**Mike Crittenden** talks about why [your calendar should not be a blocklist but an allowlist](https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/). Although I agree with in principle, I think its extremely hard to do unless you are at a senior leadership level.

Are you a master wordsmith or an incompetent dabbler? There are [7 types of writers along the competence spectrum](https://writingcooperative.com/the-7-types-of-writers-from-delusional-to-perfectionist-daf8237c49bf). **David Clear** helps you figure out what kind of writer you are so that you can diagnose your problems and improve.

**Kent Dodds** deprecated his most popular open-source library - _Glamourous_ in favor of _Emotion_. In this article he talks about [when deprecating your open sense project makes sense](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/favor-progress-over-pride-in-open-source) and how it not only greatly benefits the community but also frees you up to work on new things.

_Shameless Plug_: I wrote a [summmary of The One Page Financial Plan](https://www.discoveriesinbookland.com/blog/one-page-financial-plan) by Carl Richards. Go check it out if you think that making a financial plans has to be complex.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Copywriting is an art form in itself. These [17 copywriting tips](https://marketingexamples.com/copywriting/tips/) from **Harry Dry** can help take your message to the next level.

I have written previously about [what I look for in a job](.\dream-job). **Marquette Carney** shares some steps on [how you can find a job you love](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/find-a-job-you-love/).

**Josh Comeau** made this great site called [Operator Lookup that explains how JavaScript operators work](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/operator-lookup/).

It is easy to give useless advice and extremely difficult to give good advice. **Alexey Guzey** shares some [things to keep in mind when giving advice](https://guzey.com/advice/).

If you are interested in launching micro-businesses, **Ben Stokes** gives an update on how the [6 projects as part of his one tiny project a week are performing](https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/six_months_of_tiny_projects).

Looking to start a business with a partner? An amazing story by **Cathryn** on getting into a toxic business partnership, how she got out of it and the [things she wishes she had known to discuss in the beginning](https://www.littlemight.com/articles/expensive-lessons-learned-from-a-toxic-business-partnership).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

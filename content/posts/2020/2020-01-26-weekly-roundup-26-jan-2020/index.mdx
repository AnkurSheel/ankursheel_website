Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Growth.Design** has a new case study. This time about the success of the [Morning Brew newsletter](https://growth.design/case-studies/morning-brew-newsletter-retention/).

Would years of failure stopr you from pursuing your dream business. [Courtland Allen's](https://convertkit.com/creator-stories-courtland-allen) story over at **ConvertKit** of how he built [Indiehackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) after years of rejections is truly inspiring.

So you want to build a Data team at your company? **Helen Anderson** shares some of the [questions to ask yourself before hiring](https://dev.to/helenanders26/designing-the-data-team-2g54).

With the increasing number of options in credit cards, how do you decide which type of card is right for you. **Lars Lofgren** discusses the [pros and cons between them all](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/types-of-credit-cards/).

How do browsers resolve competing CSS styles? **Amelia Wattenberger** looks at the [different tiers of the Cascade](https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

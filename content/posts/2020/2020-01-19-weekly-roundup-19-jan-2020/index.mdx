Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

To pair or not to pair? Everyone has heard about Pair Programming but not everyone adopts it. **Birgitta Böckeler** and
**Nina Siessegger** share why they think
[Pair Programming is worth it](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html).

Would you want to build a business that makes you miserable? I am going to guess "No". **Courtland Allen** shares some
[questions you should ask youself before starting](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/questions-to-ask-yourself-before-starting-9813f617b3).

How do you decide whether to build it yourself or pay for a service?The team at **Baremetrics** has a
[calculator](https://baremetrics.com/build-vs-buy) that can help you answer this question.

I have always wondered why in the Indian culture, the ashes of the dead are immersed in rivers after cremation.
**Sadhguru** explains the
[significance of spreading the ashes in the river](https://isha.sadhguru.org/global/en/wisdom/article/immerse-ashes-dead-ganga).

Can you work so hard that your beard falls off? **Jason Lengstorf** talks about the time he joined the Overkill Cult,
how you can tell if [you are in the cult](https://lengstorf.com/overkill-cult/) and how you can escape it.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

If you are using object styles for CSS-in-JS like how I am using for this blog and need to convert large blocks of css
styles from tutorials, [CSS2JS](https://css2js.dotenv.dev/) from **Sara Viera** is a handy tool which transforms between
CSS, JS objects and React props.

**Tim Urban** has a whimsical article on how the
[coronavirus is manufactured](https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html) by a world much smaller than us to cause a
scary global crisis so that humans can realise that they are a single team alone in a dangerous universe.

**Ahmad Shadeed** has a [deep dive on viewport units in CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/viewport-units/) which
includes the different use case for them.

**Kent Dodd** has a great tutorial on
[how to build a custom dev tool using react](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/make-your-own-dev-tools) to do things like
control feature toggles, latency etc.

**Erik Kennedy** has 7 rules for creating gorgeous UI's without going into any theory. Its divided into 2 parts which
you find at [Part 1](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1.html) and
[Part 2](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2.html)

**Michael Bierut** has some great tips on
[what you can do in a recession](https://designobserver.com/feature/designing-through-the-recession/7177). The best
thing is that the tips make sense even in good times.

**Charity Majors** has a great post on
[why they promoted their VP of Engineering from within](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/honeycomb-welcomes-new-vp-engineering-why-its-so-important-to-look-inside-your-org-before-you-look-outside/).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

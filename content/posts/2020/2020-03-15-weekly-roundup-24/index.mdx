Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Whats the worst that can happen when you stop paying your credit card. **Lars Lofgren** shares
[what happens at the 30 day, 60 day, 90 day and 180 day intervals](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/stop-paying-credit-cards/).
He also gives some tips to deal with collection agencies and other options to consider if you can't pay your debts.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

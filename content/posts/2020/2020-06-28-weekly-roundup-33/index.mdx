Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

The build-vs-buy debate is an interesting one and most tech companies will err on the side of build. **Nočnica Fee**
explains the short-sightedness of this decision by way of a story of
[how a company goes from "make money" to "run servers"](https://dev.to/heroku/how-to-waste-half-a-million-dollars-474e).

I have never really enjoyed the daily standup because it gives me no useful information and feels like a status update.
The team from **LinearB** shares the
[3 questions that we can ask to make this meeting more valuable](https://dev.to/linearb_inc/stand-up-2-0-it-s-time-to-ditch-the-daily-from-1993-5d6l).

How do you spread the word about your product when you are just starting? **Gabor Cselle** gives
[9 tips to add virality into your product](https://medium.com/gabor/9-ways-to-build-virality-into-your-product-5975e1fe74e3).

Everyone knows about ToDo lists. **Drew Bredvick** explains
[why Not-ToDo lists are as important when deciding what to work on](https://drew.tech/what-not-to-work-on).

**Hiten Shah** looks at some of the
[strategies Atlassian employed to become a \$10 Billion company](https://usefyi.com/atlassian-history/). The most
interesting part of the case study is that they were self-funded and profitable before they decided to work for
investors.

**Ramit Sethi** shows you how to know which
[type of customers won't buy from you](https://growthlab.com/people-who-never-buy/) so that you concentrate on the ones
that will.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

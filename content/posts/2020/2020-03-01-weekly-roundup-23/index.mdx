Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Renting a car can be expensive. **Lars Lofgren** shares a [list of tricks to save car rental costs](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-find-cheap-car-rental/).

Links and Buttons can be confusing. How do you decide when to use which? There is a [a complete guide to links and buttons](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/) over at **CSS-Tricks**.

**Stephanie Eckles** gives examples to help you decide which out of the many [CSS units for relative spacing](https://dev.to/5t3ph/guide-to-css-units-for-relational-spacing-1mj5) you should use.

Can you redesign a component without touching the HTML? **Ahmad Shadeed** takes an article header card component and [redesigns it into 5 different designs by just modifying the CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/same-html-different-css/). He also ensures that all of them are accessible, responsive, performant and progressively enhanced.

If you are like me you just use _console.log()_ when using the console for debugging. But the console object has so many more options. **Travis Almand** shares the [various commands that can be used in the browsers console output](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-console-commands/)

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Wondering if [you should buy or rent](./rent-buy-house)? Luckily there is a tool that can help answer such questions for you. [Casual](https://www.causal.app/) by **Taimur Abdaal** and **Lukas Koebis** is a tool that helps to account for uncertainty when building models and forecasts.

You have probably heard that SQL Injection is a common attack vector for infiltrating a web application. **Omer Hamerman** shows [how a hacker can use this vulnerability to attack your application](https://omerxx.com/sql-injection-intro/).

**Aaron Xie** shows how you would approach [designing a service like TinyURL and Instagram](https://www.educative.io/blog/system-design-tinyurl-instagram) from a system perspective.

**David Perell** tells you [what lessons you can take from different fields](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1192474076360654850.html).

Serilog is a really good logging library for .Net. **Ben Foster** presents some [tips and best practices using Serilog](https://ben.onfabrik.com/blog/serilog-logging-best-practices) in your web applications.

**Steve Smith** shares the [different options to run a local test email server](https://ardalis.com/configuring-a-local-test-email-server) so that you can validate that your code runs without actually sending emails.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

## Installing Apache on Windows

-   Go to the [Apache Website](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) and download the installer file.

-   Make sure Internet Information Services (IIS) is not running.

-   If IIS is running, you will find the IIS console at Start->Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Internet Services
    Manager. Shut it down.

-   Run the installer

-   In the Server Information dialogue, enter the following

    -   **Network Domain:** The domain name. For local testing, enter _localhost_.

    -   **Server Name:** The name of the server. For local testing, enter _localhost_.

    -   **Email Address:** The email address where you want to recieve email messages about the webserver.

    -   **Run Mode:** In most cases, you would want to run Apache as a service.

-   You can change the installation directory if you click on Custom.

-   Click Install.

## Installing and Starting Apache Manually

If you chose to run the apache server manually in the Run Mode, you will have to install it. This can be done as follows

-   Run the command prompt as **Administrator**.

-   Navigate to the bin directory in the Apache install directory and run the following command: _httpd.exe -k install_

-   Start the server using the Apache Monitor in the taskbar.

## Un-Installing Apache

Navigate to the bin directory in the Apache install directory and run the following command _httpd.exe -k uninstall_

## Configuring Apache

To change any settings, edit the httpd.conf file. On Windows, you can access this file through the menu at Start ->
Programs -> Apache HTTPD Server -> Configure Apache Server -> Edit the Apache httpd.conf File.

Restart the server for the changes to take effect.

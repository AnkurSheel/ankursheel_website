## Installing PHP on Windows

-   Go to the PHP website and download the zip file.

-   Make sure the zip file contains the dll for the right version of the apache.

-   Extract the zip file to a location which does not contain spaces.

## Configuring APACHE for PHP

Open httpd.conf for editing. You can access this file through the menu at Start -> Programs -> Apache HTTPD Server ->
Configure Apache Server -> Edit the Apache httpd.conf File

-   Configure Apache to load the PHP module.

    -   Find the _**LoadModule**_ section.

    -   Add the following line to _LoadModule php5_module_ “[path to php5apache2_4.dl in the PHP folder]”. This would be
        something Like _"D:/Softwares/php/php5apache2_4.dll"_. Make sure that you use forward slashes.

-   Configure Apache to recognize PHP extensions.

    -   Find the _**AddType**_ section.

    -   Add the following line _AddType application/x-httpd-php .php_

-   Restart the APACHE server.

If you see errors, check the Apache error.log

## Configuring PHP

-   Copy _php.ini_ to the Windows directory.

-   Open _php.ini_ for editing.

-   Set your local timezone.

    -   Find this line; date.timezone = and remove the semicolon in front of it.

    -   Find the timezone code from Php timezones and add the code for the timezone after the = sign.

-   Restart the APACHE server.

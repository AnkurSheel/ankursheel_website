I had recently come across an interesting article which gave a nice guideline to learn the basics of 3D programming.
This list got me thinking about how I would go about understanding 3D programming. Even though my list is similar to the
list in the article, I would go about it differently. So without further ado, here's my list to achieve basic
proficiency in 3D programming.

-   Build your own custom graphic initialization function.

    -   This is useful to understand how things are managed internally and will give you more comprehension of what you
        are doing.

-   Code a 2D custom Graphic User Interface (GUI).

    -   This is useful since you can make your custom GUI controls and understand concepts like event handling and event
        capturing.

-   Implement a camera system.

    -   This is useful to understand concepts like vector handling, translation matrices, angle conversion, etc.

-   Understand primary 3D concepts.

-   Successfully make a collision algorithm.

-   Code a 3D model loader.

    -   This is useful to understand how 3D models are saved and how everything itâ€™s drawn in a graphics engine.

-   Implement custom lighting.

-   Implement a small particle engine.

    -   This is useful to understand concepts like particle emitters, particle behaviour and billboarding techniques.

-   Learn the basics in a 3D modelling software.

    -   Without this knowledge, you will have to depend on other people to make the art for your first few games.

-   Load and play an animation.

Hopefully, this will help people getting started with 3D programming.

We had been planning to go to Smoke House Deli since its inception in Bangalore but did not get a chance until recently.
We had already been left high and dry a few days back because we forgot to make the reservations in time. This time
around Gunjan decided not to take any chances, and armed with a reservation(for four) we headed to Smoke House Deli for
dinner at the start of the week.

This gleaming white building is enclosed by a picket fence, teeming with plants and garden chairs. Since there was a
slight nip in the air we decided to it inside and were quickly shown to our table by the extremely courteous staff. We
opted for tap water and were pleasantly surprised to find that it had been steeped with lime and mint leaves. For a
change, we decided to skip the alcohol and hence ordered the Watermelon Mint Juice and the Kiwi, Melon, Jasmine,
Lemonade cooler. The cooler was extremely refreshing after a long day at work and I would be as happy as a clam to have
it again on a warm summers day.

For appetizers, we ordered the Cottage Cheese Skewers and the Lamb Kibbeh. While we were waiting for the appetizers, the
staff brought assorted pieces of bread to our table. The cottage cheese in the skewers was really soft. However, I felt
it to be a little lacking in the marination. I would have been happier if they had provided with a mint (chutney) dip.
The Lamb Kibbeh, on the other hand, was cooked to perfection and was accompanied with the queso(cheese) dip peppered
with garlic and chillies.

You know the powers that maybe are pushing you to have brinner(Breakfast for Dinner) when the restaurant offers an
All-Day Breakfast menu. Dhruv gave in to the temptation and ordered the Mild English Cheddar Omelet and a side of
Breakfast Bacon. Gunjan was eyeing the Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli while Anuradha decided to try the Tomato Polenta with
Grilled Vegetables and Pesto Cream. I decided to try their Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin with Burnt Butter Hollandaise and
Grilled Vegetables. The dishes took some time to make it our table but the staff made sure that there was bread on our
table while we were waiting. The omelette was really soft and you must try them especially if you decide to come here
for breakfast. I did not particularly enjoy the bacon as it was chewy and not crispy and crunchy. The ravioli was cooked
perfectly with a generous amount of filling. The sauce was not too creamy and the addition of olives was a nice touch. I
did not like the polenta and I suspect that was mainly because the tomato was in the base instead of the sauce. The
tenderloin was a little too rubbery for me. It was a real let down which was a shame because the hollandaise and the
grilled vegetables would have been a great accompaniment with a well-made tenderloin dish.

Even though all of us were stuffed by this point, passing up on the desert did not even cross our minds. Gunjan had been
wanting to try a Pannacotta ever since she saw it on one of the Masterchef shows. The moment we entered the restaurant
she saw that SHD has a pannacotta and that too a blueberry one she knew what she was having for dessert. She had gone
ahead and preordered it before even ordering the drinks and appetizers, lest it they run out by the time we got around
to dessert. We finished our meal with a White Chocolate and Orange Crème Brulee, Blueberry Pannacotta and the Flourless
Chocolate Fudge cake. The crème Brulee was near perfect and the crisp on top was especially nice. The Blueberry
Pannacotta was sublime (Gunjan’s words not mine, since I didn’t even get to taste it) with a generous helping of
blueberries. The Flourless Chocolate Fudge cake was absolutely flawless. The ice-cream that came with it was rich and
creamy. All in all, all of us were glad, we didn’t skip dessert.

Although the dishes are on the expensive side, the portions are generous. The staff is extremely courteous. I would
recommend making reservations as this place was decently crowded even for a Monday evening. We plan to come back soon to
try their burgers and sandwiches.

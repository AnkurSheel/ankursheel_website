Welcome to my blog. Over a period of time, I hope to fill this space with travel and food related posts, the status of
my projects as well as tutorials for some basic stuff.

I am currently working on a basic GameEngine that can be reused easily. I have currently reused variations of the engine
for a Pong clone and an Asteroid clone.Currently, I am working on a BreakOut Clone. Needless to say, features are added
in continuously.

The first few tutorials will be cross posted from my previous blog with minor updates to how the library looks right
now.

Tune in later for an update.

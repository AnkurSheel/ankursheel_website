[Previous Post in Series: Directory Structure](./setting-project-directory-structure)

Now that we have decided the basic directory structure and dependencies that each project will have, we will now set the
project properties. I prefer to do this at the project level so that the properties are persistent and I don't have to
set them every time I download the project. The steps are based on Visual Studio 2010, but you should be able to adapt
them to a different IDE as well.

## Setting up the Main Exe Project

-   Create a Win 32 Project and delete all the files except for stdafx.h, stdafx.cpp.

-   Create a new folder called Source and move the above files in there (I prefer all my source files in one main
    directory.

-   In the property settings for the project perform the following steps

    -   For Both Release and Debug Modes

        -   In the tab C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories add

        -   ..\..\Engine\Source\Base\Includes

        -   ..\..\Engine\Source\Utilities\Includes

        -   ..\..\Engine\Source\GameBase\Includes

        -   ..\Game\Includes

    -   For Debug Mode

        -   In the tab Debugging -> Working Directory add

            -   ..\..\Debug\

        -   In the tab Debugging -> Target Name add

            -   \$(ProjectName)\_D

        -   In the tab Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories add

            -   ..\..\Debug\

        -   In the tab Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies add

            -   Utilities_D.lib

            -   Base_D.lib

            -   Game_D.lib

    -   For Release Mode

        -   In the tab Debugging -> Working Directory add

            -   ..\..\bin\

        -   In the tab Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories add

            -   ..\..\bin\

        -   In the tab Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies add

            -   Utilities.lib

            -   Base.lib

            -   Game.lib

## Setting up the DLL's

I will explain how to set up one of the lib projects which links to an extern library. Properties for all the other
projects can be set in the same way by looking at the dependencies from the
[previous tutorial](./setting-project-directory-structure)

-   Create a Win 32 Project but change the Application Type to DLL and delete all the files except for stdafx.h,
    stdafx.cpp _(For tutorial purposes we will be setting up the Utilities project)._

-   Create a new folder called Source and move the above files in there.

-   In the property settings for the project perform the following steps

    -   For Both Release and Debug Modes

        -   In the tab C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories add

            -   Includes

                -   ..\Base\Includes

                -   ..\..\extern\Include

        -   In the tab Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories add

            -   ..\..\extern\Lib\Zlib

            -   ..\..\extern\Lib\TinyXml\VS2010

    -   For Debug Mode

        -   In the tab Debugging -> Working Directory add

            -   ..\..\Debug\

        -   In the tab Debugging -> Target Name add

            -   \$(ProjectName)\_D

        -   In the tab Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories add

            -   ..\..\..\Debug\

        -   In the tab Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies add

            -   Base_D.lib

    -   For Release Mode

        -   In the tab Debugging -> Working Directory add

            -   ..\..\bin\

        -   In the tab Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories add

            -   ..\..\..\bin\

        -   In the tab Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies add

            -   Base.lib

## Notes:

-   To point to the DirectX directory we can use the visual studio macro \$(DXSDK_DIR)\Include.

-   I use the suffix \_D to distinguish between debug and release builds.

-   For the most part, only the Include folder should be added in the additional include directories.

## Final Thoughts

This finishes the initial setup. Since I am not sure, how much detail I should get into of why I set up my projects this
way, I will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

In this series, I will cover how to setup WordPress locally so that you can develop locally before pushing your
blog/website on the cloud. You might also want to set up WordPress locally if you are planning to develop plugins or
themes, I will be covering the following aspects

## The Series

1. [Installing a Web Server (Apache)](./installing-apache)

1. [Installing PHP](./installing-php)

1. [Installing MySQL](./installing-mysql)

1. [Installing phpMyAdmin](./installing-phpmyadmin)

1. [Installing Wordpress](./installing-wordpress)

You can always use existing packages such as [XAMPP](www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) to take care of installing an
Apache Web Server along with MySQL, PHP and PERL. However, I will outline how you can install each component separately.

**Update: 19 Dec 2013:** Sharad pointed out that you can also use [bitnami app stack](http://bitnami.com/).

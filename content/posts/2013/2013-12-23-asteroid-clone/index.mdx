## Why Asteroids

-   Its a free form game with irregular geometry which requires a more robust collision detection system.

-   The ship has to move and accelerate in a way that resembles basic physics.

-   A High Score table makes sense since the scores can vary each game.

-   Concept of Lives/Health.

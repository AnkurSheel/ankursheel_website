title: "Ankur Sheel's Rants and Ramblings"
---

By good fortune, you have stumbled upon the website of Ankur Sheel. I am a programmer, an avid traveller and a complete
foodie.

I write software to solve problems. In an erstwhile life, I used to make games for a living. Now I strive to help people
become more efficient and productive. I also dabble in a bit of photography. Iâ€™m addicted to travel. I try to get out of
the city regularly with a yearly overseas trip. I am also a complete foodie and am continuously trying out new places to
eat.

Feel free to follow the links to my [blog](/blog), [professional projects](./cv/professional-projects) or other projects
I do in my free time.

I would love to chat about job opportunities, projects, questions or whatever else that is on your mind.

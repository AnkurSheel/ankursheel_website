By good fortune, you have stumbled upon my website. I am a programmer, an avid traveller and a complete foodie.

I write software to solve problems. In an erstwhile life, I used to make games for a living. Now I strive to help people become more efficient and productive. I also dabble in a bit of photography. Iâ€™m addicted to travel. I try to get out of the city regularly with a yearly overseas trip. I am also a complete foodie and am continuously trying out new places to eat.

Feel free to follow the links to my [blog](/blog), [professional projects](/cv/professional-projects) or other projects I do in my free time.

I would love to chat about job opportunities, projects, questions or whatever else that is on your mind.

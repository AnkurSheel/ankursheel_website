# Summary

I am a software developer who strives to help people become more efficient and productive. I take an active interest in
improving processes to benefit my team members. I enjoy building tools which help reduce the time taken by my team
members to complete tasks. I specialize in making code maintainable by using refactoring techniques and adding unit and
system test coverage. I have often been brought into different projects because of my debugging skills. I also enjoy
extending my technical skill set by indulging in side projects.

## The Game

APOX is a real-time strategy game that uniquely includes gameplay concepts from first-person shooters. Like in an FPS, you can prone, crouch, switch active weapons, throw grenades, and loot corpses. Soldiers in APOX have limited ammo, but ammo sharing is done seamlessly. Soldiers can be placed in vehicles, and this essentially lets you create your unit designs. APOX keeps everything that makes RTS great like making bases, controlling strategic sites, and managing your resources. Play with your friends against bots in co-op mode or play against other people in versus mode.

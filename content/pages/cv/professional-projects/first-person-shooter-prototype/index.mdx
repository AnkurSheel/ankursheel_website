## Organization

Gameloft

## The Game

A First Person Shooter prototype.

## Technology

C++, Unreal Engine

## Role

-   Responsible for planning and scheduling all the AI-related tasks for the game.

-   Answering designer questions about using the engine for AI.

-   Implemented a Probability Selector node to the behaviour tree system (in Unreal) to give the designers more flexibility. This was eventually used to randomly play enemy barks.

-   Added perception such as sight, sound and damage to the enemies. This was then used to make them react to their surroundings.

-   Added support for making the NPC's jump and crouch. Taught the designers how to annotate the navigation meshes.

-   Added a spawner with multiple parameters so that the designers could easily add waves of enemies.

-   Implemented a system to allow a voice for enemies while making sure that only limited voices could be heard at any given time.

-   Optimised the algorithms when we realised that some of them were using a lot of cycles unnecessarily.

-   Created the initial behaviours for different enemy types as specified by the designers. This was eventually taken care of by the designers and another programmer.

-   Helped with implementing the final boss AI for the prototype.

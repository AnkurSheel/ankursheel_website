## Organization

## The Project

Merchant Portal used by church admins and staff.

## Technology

C#, Typescript, React

## Role

-   Built a protoype to generate typings based on graphql queries and schema without requiring an active connction to
    the server which enabled drontend development to happen without relying on backend development.
-   I came up with a strategy and roll out plan to add Content Security policy to the website.
-   I created a postman collection which enabled QA to test ajax endpoints protected against Cross Site Request Forgery
    attacks (by automatically adding the anti-forgery token to the request).
-   DX improvements
    -   Added gists to enable debugging frontend using vs code and starting the dev server automatically.
    -   After finding issues with yarn link found an alternate packageÂ yalc which works better.
    -   Automatically collapsing generated files in PR.
-   Feature Lead for various features which involved:
    -   breaking down the feature in smaller tickets and assigning them to team members.
    -   communicating status updates to business.

## Awards

-   High Five Award for the Content Security Policy work.

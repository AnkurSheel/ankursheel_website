## A Route planner

Route planner is based on Randy Olson's article "Computing the optimal road trip across the U.S." It takes a list of waypoints and uses googlemaps to get the distance between them. A genetic algorithm used to solve the Travelling Salesman problem, finds a solution of the optimal route for us. It then spits out a html file with the route and directions.

Made with Python, C++

## An autonomous robot that navigates a maze and find a pre-defined object

It uses a motion model to recalculate the probabilities of its current location in the maze using an ultrasonic sensor. It also uses blob-recognition to find the object in the maze.

Made with C++

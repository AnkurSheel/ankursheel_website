Budgeting is essential to attain financial independence. **Pamela** from **My Money Counts** tells you how to implement your budget like a corporation.

Are you thinking of buying a house? Read my article about whether [you should purchase or rent](./rent-buy-house). Still convinced that buying is the right decision for you. **Jon** at **Money Smart Guides** has a [complete guide to buying a house](http://www.moneysmartguides.com/ultimate-guide-buying-a-house).

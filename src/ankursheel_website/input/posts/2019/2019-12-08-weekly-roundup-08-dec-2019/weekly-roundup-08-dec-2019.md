Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Do you regard "no-code" as a threat? **Shawn Wang** shares why ["no-code" is a lie](https://webflow.com/blog/no-code-is-a-lie) and its a start towards moving to a GUI economy from the API economy. It's a win for coders because of the better developer tools available so that they can focus on solving complex problems. After all, "no-code" just means "tons of code but just not your code".

Ever wondered [how Y Combinator started](http://paulgraham.com/ycstart.html)? I found an old post by **Paul Graham** which talks about just that.

Did you know that a royal family is living in a 14th Century lodge in New Delhi? I found [this story](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/world/asia/the-jungle-prince-of-delhi.html) by **Ellen Barry** truly fascinating.

What is a coach, and what do they do? **Joseph Mosby** talks about just this and how an organization like Delloite makes sure that [each person has a coach and aligns their processes around it](https://josephmosby.com/2019/11/19/you-should-have-a-coach.html).

How do you decide what problem to solve when? By using Level setting, of course. **Jason Lengstorf** shows the [three levels of problem-solving applied to a Thanksgiving dinner](https://lengstorf.com/level-setting/).

Is your site accessible to people with vision impairments? [Who can use](https://whocanuse.com/?b=da3&c=302929&f=22&s=b) by **Corey Ginnivan** shows you a simulation of different vision types for two colours. The one feature that I have not seen elsewhere in the simulation is how the colours look in direct sunlight.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

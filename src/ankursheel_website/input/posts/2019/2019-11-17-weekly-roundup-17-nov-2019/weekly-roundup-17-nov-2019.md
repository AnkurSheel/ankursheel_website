Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Martin Gasston** has some great advice on [writing technical articles](https://8thlight.com/blog/martin-gaston/2019/10/22/tips-for-technical-writing.html) at the 8th Light blog. He also has some creative writing exercises to help you along. If you are looking for a template, he also has that covered.

[**Clippy â€“ CSS clip-path Maker**](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) is a handy tool (made by **Bennet Feely**) to create shapes using the `clip-path` CSS property. It also comes with some predefined shapes.

How do the most popular testing tools for React compare to each other? **Sunil Sandhu** tests the same app using Jest, Enzyme, Testing Library, and Cypress.Check it out [here](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-tested-a-react-app-with-jest-testing-library-and-cypress-here-are-the-differences-3192eae03850)

Ever wondered what type of developer you are? **Neil Green** has a [handy quiz](https://www.12types.dev/quiz). My top trait was _The Assassin_: capable of quickly and quietly finishing their work before anyone even knows they have started. I think this will also be a suitable tool to ask your coworkers to fill for you.

**Neal Agarwal** has a fantastic tour of scale within the known universe at [The Size of Space](https://neal.fun/size-of-space/).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

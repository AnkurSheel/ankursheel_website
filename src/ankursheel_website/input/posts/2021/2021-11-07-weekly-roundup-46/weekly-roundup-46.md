Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

You have probably heard of the [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/), but it's 20 years old, and most companies can answer **yes** to those questions. These questions are better suited to rate the quality of a software team in today's world.

When working with .Net Core, it can be useful to inspect the resolved configuration settings to determine why a configuration value does not have the value we expect. This post shows how to use `GetDebugView()` to determine where the configuration values have come from. It also goes through the implementation.

## [The Three Sides of Risk](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/)

In this post, we will see how we can run SQL Server on Docker. We will be launching the SQL server container using docker-compose and managing the image and environment variables in a docker file.

### Docker Compose file

To launch a SQL Server container, we will first create a `docker-compose.yml` file. I like to keep my docker scripts in a folder called **_build._**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
    db:
        container_name: sql_server_db
        build:
            context: ./../
            dockerfile: ./build/mssqlserver.Dockerfile
        ports:
            - '1433:1433'
```

-   **Line #1**: This denotes that we are using version 3.8 of Docker compose so that Docker can provide the appropriate features.
-   **Line #3** This section defines all the different containers we will create.
-   **Line #4**: The name of the SQL Server Database service. _Can be anything._
-   **Line #5**: A custom container name rather than a generated default name so that we can easily find the container in Docker.
-   **Line #6**: Configuration options that are applied at build time
-   **Line #7:** Setting this to `.\..\` allows the build process to access any of the files in the root folder.
-   **Line #8**: Set the path to the docker file relative to the context path.
-   **Line #9-10**: SQL Server is listening on port 1433 in the container, and we want to expose it on port 1433, on the host.

### Docker file for SQL Server

We can start by adding the base image and environment variables to the docker file.

```docker
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest

ARG SA_PASSWORD="Password1!"
ENV SA_PASSWORD=$SA_PASSWORD
ENV ACCEPT_EULA="Y"

EXPOSE 1433
```

-   **Line #1**: Pull down the SQL Server 2017 container image.
-   **Line #3**: Set the SA_PASSWORD as a variable so that it can be reused.
-   **Line #4**: Specify the strong password that meets SQL Server password requirements as an environment variable.
-   **Line #5**: Sets the environment variable to confirm our acceptance of the End-User Licensing Agreement.
-   **Line #7**: Expose the port to access it from composed containers. _SQL server listens for a connection on TCP port 1433 by default_.

### Initialize SQL server in Docker container

Add the following lines to the docker file to initialize SQL Server.

```docker
RUN mkdir -p /usr/work
COPY ./build/*.sql /usr/work/

WORKDIR /usr/work

RUN ( /opt/mssql/bin/sqlservr & ) \
    | grep -q "Service Broker manager has started" \
    && /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P $SA_PASSWORD -i create-db.sql \
    && pkill sqlservr
```

-   **Line #1**: Run a command to create a new directory creating all the directories in the path.
-   **Line #2**: Copy all the SQL files into the created directory.
-   **Line #4**: Set the working directory for the subsequent instructions.
-   **Line #6**: Starts the SQL server.
-   **Line #7**: Wait for _sqlservr_ to start by checking the logs. _grep_ will block until it has found the string and then exit.
-   **Line #8**: Run _sqlcmd_ to run _create-db.sql_ which scaffolds our database.
-   **Line #9**: Kill the _sqlservr_ process.

### Script to scaffold our database

In our SQL script, we can do whatever we need to do at startup. In this demo, we will just create a database with a schema.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE DemoDb;
GO
USE DemoDb;
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Table1]
(
    [Id] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    [Name] NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
)

GO
```

### Running the container

We can use the following command to run start the DB using from the root folder.

```bash
docker-compose -f ./build/docker-compose.yml up -d --force-recreate --build db
```

## Conclusion

Starting a new Docker container with Microsoft SQL Server is really simple. However, there are a few hoops to jump through. I hope that itâ€™s easy to understand how it works after reading this article.

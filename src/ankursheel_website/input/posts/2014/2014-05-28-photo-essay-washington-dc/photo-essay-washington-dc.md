After Graceland, we decided to take a break at one of our relatives house in Rydal, Pennsylvania.

Since I had already visited part of the east coast earlier, I took a break while my parents visited the sights in Philadelphia, New York and Washington D.C.

I joined them on the trip to Washington and took a couple of pictures. Let's see if you can guess the landmarks?

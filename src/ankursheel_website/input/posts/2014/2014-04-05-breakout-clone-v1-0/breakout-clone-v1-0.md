The first release of the Breakout clone is finally here.

The [Installer](/assets/downloads/Breakout_setup_v1.1.exe) will install DirectX and the visual studio 2010 re-distributable.

If you prefer to run the game through a zip file, you can download it from [here](/assets/downloads/Breakout.zip). You will have to make sure that you have the visual studio 2010 re-distributable and the latest DirectX installed on your machine.

Try it out. In case you face any problems while installing or running the game, let me know, and I will try to come up with a solution.

Looking forward to hearing your comments on the game :-)

After a well deserved rest in Rydal, PA, we continued on our journey and to reach our next stop and bask in the glory of  the Niagara Falls.

Unfortunately, I was not able to cross over to the Canadian side because of a lack of visa, but my parents did so and it's definitely recommended to get a Canadian visa just to get a view of the falls from the other side.

Also, a ride on the _**"Maid of the Mist"** is a must do_.

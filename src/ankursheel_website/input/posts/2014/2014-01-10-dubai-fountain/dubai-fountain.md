By the time we finished with Burj Khalifa and came back down, it was late evening. We decided to check out the promenade and another attraction at the Dubai Mall - The Dubai Fountain. At the risk of sounding like a commercial, Set in Burj Khalifa Lake, right outside The Dubai Mall on the Lower Ground Waterfront Promenade, is the world’s largest dancing fountain (the water spray shoots up to 50 stories). The fountain dances to the music of various artists. It was packed by the time we reached the promenade, and we could not find a place to rest our tired legs.

Every half hour, there is a show with the fountain dancing to a different piece of music every time. We mainly caught the second performance because we were still tired of walking/standing, and we managed to find a place to sit.

## Where should you stand/sit to get the best view?

When you come outside the Dubai Mall onto the promenade, start walking right till you cross the bridge/incline. Place yourself somewhere here so that you can view the entire width of the fountain. Another option is to sit in one of the surrounding coffee shops and enjoy the show over a cup of coffee.

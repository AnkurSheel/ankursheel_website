Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

How can you get 2 elements on your web page to overlap? **Sarah Drasner** shows the [2 ways you can achieve overlapping elements](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-stack-elements-in-css/). One is the old school _position_ property. The other method is the new and shiny _CSS grid_.

[30 seconds of code](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/) has some handy code snippets in JS, CSS, Python, React and PHP.

**Valia Havryliuk** shares her [collection of stock photos and image sites](https://dev.to/valiahavryliuk/picking-the-right-stock-photo-for-your-next-design-project-36bd) so that you can find the perfect visual for your next article or project.

Fare Alerts can save you a lot of time when trying to find the best deal on your flight. **Matt Moffitt** shares the [different services you can use to set up fare alerts](https://www.pointhacks.co.nz/fare-alerts-cheap-flights/).

**zechtyounes** shares the [pros and cons of the 3 major hosting platforms](https://dev.to/zechtyounes/gitlab-vs-github-vs-bitbucket-which-one-deserve-your-time-2npm) - Github, Gitlab and BitBucket.

Was the birth of [cilivilization and agriculture just an accident](http://theconversation.com/how-the-extinction-of-ice-age-mammals-may-have-forced-us-to-invent-civilisation-128799) and driven by disaster? **Nick Longrich** shares his thoughts on why he thinks so.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

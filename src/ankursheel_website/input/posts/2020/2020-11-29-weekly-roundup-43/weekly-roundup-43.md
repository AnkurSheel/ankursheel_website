Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Cryptic error messages are annoying. These [error message design principles](https://www.swyx.io/write-errors-that-don-t-make-me-think-24hg/) by **Shawn Wang** is something everyone should consider when writing error messages so that their users don't have to think when something goes wrong.

Money rules are crucial to building the life that you want. **Richard Boehmcke** shares [Ramit Sethi's 10 money rules that you can take as an inspiration](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/money-rules/) to create a list tailored to you.

As a developer, you want to write code that is well structured and easy to follow. **Kealan Parr** gives [examples of the 6 anti-patterns that people use to solve problems](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/antipatterns-to-avoid-in-code/) but end up adding technical debt.

Is age the only reason that there is a bias against older devs? **Adam Davis** makes a few observations on [why older people find it more challenging to fit in](https://dev.to/bytebodger/why-older-people-struggle-in-programming-jobs-1pj0).

"Writing daily will help you become a daily writer" is a given. **Facundo Gauna** started an experiment of [blogging daily for 100 days and shares some of the unexpected things that happened](https://dev.to/fgauna12/i-wrote-a-daily-blog-post-for-100-days-here-s-what-happened-3673).

There is no doubt that Graphql is the future of API's. But **Jens Neuse** suggests that [most of the benefits that the community advertises are very generic and have nothing to do with Graphql](https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql). According to him, it's the tools and the ecosystem around it that make it powerful.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

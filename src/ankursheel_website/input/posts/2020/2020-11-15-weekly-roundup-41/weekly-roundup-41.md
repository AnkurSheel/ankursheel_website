Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Conversational copy is powerful, but it is hard to get right. **Harry Dry** has a [guide to conversational copy](https://marketingexamples.com/copywriting/conversational/) that can help.

The conventional advice encourages everyone to become a manager. **Charity Majors** highlights the [[17 reasons why you wouldn't want to become a manager](https://charity.wtf/2019/09/08/reasons-not-to-be-a-manager/) even in a healthy organization.

Building a good culture is hard. In this post, **Mike Crittenden** talks about what I think is the biggest mistake organizations make. Basically, r[eward the people who don't live the culture even though it looks like the latter directly benefits the business](https://critter.blog/2020/10/15/the-hero-culture-conundrum/).

Can you write code just by using your voice and eye-tracking? **Josh Comeau** shows his workflow for [writing code using a microphone and an eye-tracker](https://joshwcomeau.com/accessibility/hands-free-coding/).

It's easy for us to misunderstand harmless questions and statements. Paraphrasing can help us avoid this. **Padmini Pyapali** shares some [examples of how paraphrasing can be used in different contexts](https://smallbigideas.substack.com/p/no-more-misunderstandings) to make a conversation more positive and productive. Although, I am not sure how achievable it is in practice.

Even though low code/no code won't replace programmers, it is the future because it makes technology more accessible to everyone. **Rex Woodbury** takes a look at the [no-code movement and the rise of creator platforms like Roblox](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/roblox-airtable-and-the-building).

In case you missed it, I wrote a book summary of [Death by Meeting](https://www.discoveriesinbookland.com/blog/death-meeting) by Patrick M. Lencioni.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

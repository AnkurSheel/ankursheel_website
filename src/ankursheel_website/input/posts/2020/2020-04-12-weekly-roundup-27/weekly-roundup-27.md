Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

There are a lot of reasons to ensure that a website is accessible. **Bruce Lawson** shares [16 tips to improve accessibility](https://websitesetup.org/web-accessibility-checklist/). There is also a 6-minute video with Leonie Watson using her screen reader to navigate his site.

Continuing with the theme of accessibility **Austin Gil** examines the [proper semantics to build an HTML form](https://stegosource.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/).

If you have had difficulty understanding the SOLID principles, you need to see these [real world examples with illustrations of the SOLID principles](https://dev.to/trekhleb/s-o-l-i-d-principles-around-you-1o17) by **Oleksii Trekhleb**.

**Kyle Shevlin** has a great example of how [functional programming can help reduce the cyclomatic complexity](https://kyleshevlin.com/managing-cyclomatic-complexity) of your program.

**Adam Giebl** has made a tool to [generate Soft-UI CSS code](https://neumorphism.io/#55b9f3) to achieve Neumorphic effects.

If you are a programmer, you would have heard of the Big O notation. But have you heard about Big L notation? **Shawn Wang** sketches out the [Big L notation which plots your learning as a function of N years of experience with P peers](https://www.swyx.io/writing/big-l-notation/).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

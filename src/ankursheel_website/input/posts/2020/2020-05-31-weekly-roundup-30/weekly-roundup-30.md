Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

If you are a developer, branching and merging is just a way of life. **Martin Fowler** talks about the [different patterns that have emerged over the years](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html) and when you should use which one.

It's common knowledge that you should have an emergency fund. But, you have to remember that an emergency fund is exactly what it says a fund for emergencies. **Ramit Sethi** talks about the [psychology of actually using your emergency fund](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-build-an-emergency-fund/) when you need to.

**Pathik Desai** shares the [different aspects that need to be handled to make your software secure](https://dev.to/pathiknd/software-security-overview-3ldi).

Would you like to make your website more independent of Google? **Marko Saric** presents [alternative solutions to de-Google-ify](https://dev.to/markosaric/how-to-de-google-ify-your-website-4bfc) your website.

**Habdul Hazeez** looks at some of the [top websites with Javascript disabled](https://dev.to/ziizium/famous-websites-with-javascript-disabled-2ib1).

**ellie-html** gives an example of how to [create Realistic CSS Art](https://dev.to/elliehtml/realistic-css-art-hacks-27pk).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

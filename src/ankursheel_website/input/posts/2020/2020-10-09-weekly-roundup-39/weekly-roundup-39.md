Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Charity Majors** shares her thought on the [different type of influence that an engineer can have](https://charity.wtf/2018/08/17/on-engineers-and-influence/) and use.

**Alex** demonstrates how he participated in the Do Not Get Arrested Challenge 2020 by [logging in as the former Australian Primer minister Tony Abbot on an airline website](https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram) and got details such as his passport id after he shared a photo of his boarding pass on Instagram. It's a long but entertaining story.

**Jared Palmer** has an excellent [takedown of the Gatsby Framework](https://jaredpalmer.com/gatsby-vs-nextjs) and why he has moved away from Gatsby to Next.js. This blog is [built on gatsby](./migrating-from-wordpress-to-gatsby), and I find it difficult to debug issues and add functionality. At least, now I know it's just not me.

How do you bootstrap a SASS company to 1 million ARR? **Sarah Hum** breaks down the [learnings from Canny's 3.5-year journey by revenue/hiring milestones](https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/). So many tidbits to take away if you are thinking of starting a SASS business.

We, as humans, find it difficult to talk about size. After all, how do you define big and small? **Tim Urban** takes the full-sized galaxies and the subatomic particles and shows the [size by scaling them into numbers we can understand](https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html). The post has some lovely illustrations to drive the point home.

A lot of successful people feel like crap all the time. But what if you could make your day more enjoyable and still be wealthy and successful. **Andrew Wilkinson** shares his list of [Anti-goals and how you can come up with the perfect day](https://medium.com/@@awilkinson/the-power-of-anti-goals-c38f5f46d23c) by thinking about your worst day and then figuring out how to avoid it

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Webmention is a way of letting a website know it has been mentioned somewhere, by someone, in some way. **Atila Fassina** has a [tutorial on adding the feature your wesbite](https://css-tricks.com/jumping-into-webmentions-with-nextjs-or-not/). It's based on NextJs, but I think it can easily be adapted to a site built with Gatsby. Now, I just need to get the time to add it to this one.

If you are wondering [what database architecture you should use](https://dev.to/harperdb/database-architectures-use-cases-explained-5711) for your next application, **Margo McCabe** has an article that helps you determine just that.

**Nick Maggiulli** explains [why gold is so valuable even though it is intrinsically worthless](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-is-gold-valuable/). He also talks about who should (or not) invest in gold.

Giving interviews is hard. **Julia Evans** talks about the importance of [telling candidates what to expect from the job interview](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/30/tell-candidates-what-to-expect-from-your-job-interviews/).

Being Indie meant being bootstrapped. **Courtland Allen** explains how it has become increasingly common to [have investors and remain Indie](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/indie-doesn-t-mean-bootstrapped-anymore-a88300c012). Although, I think that Indie as a term is overused. Even in the games industry, you can call yourself Indie as long as you don't have a multi-million dollar budget. To stay close to what I feel the term signified initially, we should probably use self-funded instead.

**Jaana Dogan** shares a few [insights for application developers who don't work a lot with databases](https://medium.com/@@rakyll/things-i-wished-more-developers-knew-about-databases-2d0178464f78).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

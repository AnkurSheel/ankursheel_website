Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

There are so [many little gems in this 1999 interview of Jeff Bezos](https://www.davidsheff.com/jeff-bezos) on **David Sheff**'s blog.

What is the difference between the Severity and Priority of bugs? Even though they are different, you can have different combinations, making it harder to decide which bug to fix. **Dan Emmons** [explains the different combinations in an obvious way](https://medium.com/@@dan.ryan.emmons/qa-severity-and-priority-guide-7bacf316db49).

Data seeding is critical for achieving isolated test runs. **Viktor Slavchev** walks us through the [multiple ways of setting up data for automated checks](https://mrslavchev.com/2020/04/01/hindsight-lessons-about-automation-the-mastery-of-data-seeding/).

There are a lot of articles out there that say that we should take a mobile-first approach for our site or app. **Matt Anderson** shows a [few examples of where this categorisation starts to break and why we should look at device capabilities instead](https://mattanddesign.com/dont-design-for-mobile/).

Even if people know what the right thing is, people will always choose the more convenient thing. **Jason Lengstorf** explains why we don't need to convince others that something is the right thing to do. We just need to [make it easier to do the thing we want to be done than to do anything else](https://lengstorf.com/right-thing-easy-thing/).

Statistics are unhelpful without context. **Robert Heaton** [dissolves some common examples of Simpson's paradox with better framing](https://robertheaton.com/2019/02/24/making-peace-with-simpsons-paradox/).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

Asking good questions is hard, but it is a super important skill. **Julia Evans** has a great list of things that can help you [ask better questions and get the answer you want](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).

**Blake Boles** explains a few [strategies for Crowdfunding](https://www.blakeboles.com/2012/05/dreamfunding/). For me, the key takeaway was how to decide what perks to give.

Most people have several lists they maintain. But have you heard of "The Suck List"? **Mike Crittenden** shares his thoughts on [why making a Suck list is helpful](https://critter.blog/2018/06/11/the-power-of-the-suck-list/) and his process for creating one.

There is a fair bit of profanity in the article, but **Charity Majors** explains why [becoming a manager is not a promotion](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) and why engineers should make a practice of going back and forth between the engineering and manager roles.

Writing understandable code is an art. In this whimsical article, **Robert Heaton** takes a few examples and shows how [you can tell a lot about the design of the code without actually reading any of it](https://robertheaton.com/2014/06/20/code-review-without-your-eyes/).

How often have you heard "At our company, we value `Strong Opinions, Loosely Held`"? I have been a big proponent of this ideology because it lets the best ideas bubble up. **Michael Natkin** explains [why the "Strong Opinions, Loosely held" mantra is less than ideal](https://blog.glowforge.com/strong-opinions-loosely-held-might-be-the-worst-idea-in-tech/) and what we can do instead.

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

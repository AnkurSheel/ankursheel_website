Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Kevin Stewart** has some great advice on how to [build an engineering team at a startup](https://increment.com/teams/how-to-build-a-startup-engineering-team/).

**Mark Dalgleish** highlights some reasons [why CSS-in-JS aka writing styles in Javascript is not a bad idea](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660).

If you struggle to understand React Components, **Mike Mangialardi** has a helpful [comparison between the components in a React application and the hierarchy of a village](https://medium.com/coding-artist/how-pure-css-images-helped-me-understand-react-components-3ad7b05051b0).

Ever had to explain to a non-technical stakeholder [why what should have been a single line change took so long](https://www.simplethread.com/dear-client-heres-why-that-change-took-so-long/)? **Al Tenhundfeld** has an excellent write-up that shows how you can communicate the reason.

**Nick Babich** reminds you of what you need to [design before shipping your mobile app](https://uxplanet.org/30-things-we-often-forget-when-designing-mobile-apps-ae30cc3b2c6b). I think most of them can also be applied to Web apps.

The Parable of Polygons by **Nicky Case** is a playable illustration of how "[harmless choices can make a harmful world](https://ncase.me/polygons/)".

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

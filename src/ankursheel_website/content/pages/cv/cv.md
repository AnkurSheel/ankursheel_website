## Summary

I am a software developer who strives to help people become more efficient and productive. I take an active interest in improving processes to benefit my team members. I enjoy building tools that help reduce the time taken by my team members to complete tasks. I specialize in making code maintainable by using refactoring techniques and adding unit and system test coverage. I have often been brought into different projects because of my debugging skills. I also enjoy extending my technical skillset by indulging in side-projects.

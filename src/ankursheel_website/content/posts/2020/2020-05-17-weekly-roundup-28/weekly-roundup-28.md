Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

It is tedious to fill forms on mobile devices. **Alex Holachek** shows how you can [correctly configure inputs](https://css-tricks.com/better-form-inputs-for-better-mobile-user-experiences/) to make filling in forms more convenient for your users on mobile devices.

How do you decide whether you should go for a [static website or a server-side software](https://css-tricks.com/static-or-not/)? **Chris Coyier** outlines excellent and wrong reasons to choose one rather than the other.

Is test-Driven-Devoplment(TDD) even possible for UI? **TK** uses [TDD to build a React component](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tdd-functions-and-react-components/).

**Ruth** from the **The Happy Saver** talks about the [lifecycle of an investor](https://www.thehappysaver.com/blog/the-life-cycle-of-an-investor) and the rough path that everyone should follow when it comes to investing star6ting from when you are born.

Ever wondered how hackers find security vulnerabilities in a computer system? **Sonya Moisset** has a [walkthrough to solve the CTF Challenge **_Lame_**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-calm-and-hack-the-box-lame/) presented by [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) for doing online penetration practices.

**Sarah Drasner** has a great [tool to generate the CSS code for a hero](https://hero-generator.netlify.app/).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

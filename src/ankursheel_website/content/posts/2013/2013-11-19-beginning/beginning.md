Welcome to my blog. Over time, I hope to fill this space with travel and food-related posts, the status of my projects, and tutorials for some basic stuff.

I am currently working on a basic GameEngine that can be reused easily. I have presently reused variations of the engine for a Pong clone and an Asteroid clone. Currently, I am working on a BreakOut Clone. Needless to say, features are added in continuously.

The first few tutorials will be cross-posted from my previous blog with minor updates to how the library looks right now.

Tune in later for an update.

I recently came across an interesting article that gave an excellent guideline to learn the basics of 3D programming. This list got me thinking about how I would go about understanding 3D programming. Even though my list is similar to the list in the article, I would go about it differently. So without further ado, here's my list to achieve basic proficiency in 3D programming.

- Build your own custom graphic initialization function.
  - This is useful to understand how things are managed internally and give you more comprehension of what you are doing.
- Code a 2D custom Graphic User Interface (GUI).
  - This is useful since you can make your custom GUI controls and understand concepts like event handling and event capturing.
- Implement a camera system.
  - This is useful to understand concepts like vector handling, translation matrices, angle conversion, etc.
- Understand primary 3D concepts.
- Successfully make a collision algorithm.
- Code a 3D model loader. This is useful for understanding how 3D models are saved and how everything is drawn in a graphics engine.
- Implement custom lighting.
- Implement a small particle engine.
  - This is useful to understand concepts like particle emitters, particle behaviour and billboarding techniques.
- Learn the basics of 3D modelling software.
  - Without this knowledge, you will have to depend on other people to make the art for your first few games.
- Load and play an animation.

Hopefully, this will help people get started with 3D programming.

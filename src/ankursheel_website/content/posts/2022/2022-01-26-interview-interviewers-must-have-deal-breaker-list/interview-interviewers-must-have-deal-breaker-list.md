At the end of most interviews will come the question, "Do you have any questions for us?" Standard advice over the interwebs is that you should always have questions to ask because it will make you look more prepared and leave a good impression. But, there is a much more critical reason to interview your interviewer.

I have worked for a few companies in my career. Some of them worked out great, while for others, after a few months of joining, I realized it wasn't a great fit.

Joining a company and finding out it isn't a good match never feels great. It can be hard to know if the company we are considering joining is a good fit (before actually joining them). But, we can increase the chances by doing a little bit of introspection and preparation.

## How to apply the lists in an interview

Now, it's unlikely that we will be able to walk into a job interview and run through our list of must-haves/deal-breakers like a checklist. After all, we can't just ask our prospective boss if they are a micromanager. But we can look for signals that can help us evaluate them.

At this point, you might wonder, how do I do that?

1. Make your own list of must-haves and deal-breakers.
2. For each item in the list, write a question.

_It's essential to keep the questions conversational and not accusatory. We should also structure the question, so the interviewer has to provide examples._

Keep the list of questions handy, so you can ask questions throughout the interview as they relate to the topic being discussed.

## My Must-Have List

- A high degree of autonomy and flexibility in managing my time and workload.
- Open communication among teammates and with management and Human Resources.
- Ability to choose my workplace tools, including both hardware and software.
- A clear and defined path toward career advancement (both in skills and compensation)
- Ability to work on non-work-related tasks for a few hours a week.
- Opportunity to spend time sharing my ideas on either mine or a company blog.
- Learning from mistakes / Blameless
- Inclusive Work environment
- Equality when it comes to stock options, reviews etc

## My Deal Breaker List

- Expected overtime.
- T-shirts/ Shorts and Sandals are not allowed.
- Mandatory in-office days/ No remote working.
- If completely remote, there is no office space or compensation to pay for a shared office space.
- Mandatory after-hours on-call.
- Micro-management.
- Lots of meetings.
- Following Dogmatic Scrum and story pointing.
- Long-lived branches.
- No automated tests / over-reliance on manual QA.
- No QA / over-reliance on automated tests / only developers testing
- Hiring mainly seniors / Not many intermediates or juniors.

_Note that these items are all about me, my values and what I want. They have very little to do with any particular job or workplace._

## Turning the list into questions

## What is an appropriate number of questions to ask?

This is quite an extensive list. We won't be able to ask all of them in a single interview. Most interviews keep only the last couple of minutes for questions. However, when interviewing for jobs, there are often multiple rounds. I would suggest choosing questions to ask at the different stages. After all, some questions are better answered by a hiring manager, while others are better answered by someone working in a similar role.

One thing I have not tried so far but intend to try next time I am interviewing is conducting a [reverse interview](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/reverse-interviewing/){target="_blank"} after I have negotiated the offer to get any unanswered questions answered.

## Conclusion

A list of questions based on our must-haves and deal-breakers can give us the confidence to know that we are making the right decision. We can down positions or step away from the interview process where there isn't a great fit. You owe it to yourself to find a place aligned with your values.

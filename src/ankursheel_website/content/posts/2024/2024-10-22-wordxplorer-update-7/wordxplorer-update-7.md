I hope you’re having an awesome day! Since the last post, we’ve been hard at work, appeasing the Apple gods to ensure our game is ready for the App Store.

And guess what? I’m thrilled to announce that our game has been approved.

## 🎨 Exciting New Theme

To make things fun and engaging for kids, we’ve decided to theme the words around “Food Items.” There are a few reasons we have chosen this theme as the first one.

- We can easily create 25-30 exciting levels for launch.
- Kids are familiar with food items and having all words around this central theme should make it easy for them to get started.
- Most importantly, we believe this theme will be a hit with children.

## 💰 Special Preorder Pricing

You can preorder the game for just USD 3.99. Apple will use this base price and adjust it for your region.

Remember, once we launch on December 1st, the price will increase to USD 4.99. So, why wait? Secure your copy now!

## 🛒 How to Preorder

Pre-ordering is simple and ensures you’re among the first to experience the game:

1. Visit the [game’s product page on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordxplorer-guess-the-word/id6504664783).
2. Click on the “Preorder” button.
3. Follow the prompts to complete your preorder. By pre-ordering, you lock in the special price and guarantee immediate access on launch day!

Rest assured, you will only be charged once the game officially launches on December 1st. And if you change your mind(I hope you don’t), you can cancel your preorder anytime before launch without penalty.

For more details, feel free to check out [Apple’s Preorder documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/118414).

## 📱 Google Play Progress

Exciting news for our Android fans! I have a working proof of concept for the game on Android devices.

While bringing the game to Google Play is definitely on our radar, our primary focus is ensuring a smooth and successful launch on the App Store.

Rest assured, expanding to Android is part of our plans. We appreciate your patience and support as we prioritise the App Store release. Stay tuned for more updates!

## 🕹️ Last Chance for Playable Build

This is your final opportunity to check out the latest update to our [Playable Web Build](https://golden-pony-d2c3f0.netlify.app/) or TestFlight build. Your feedback would mean the world to us! If you’re eager to have the full experience, just let me know, and I’ll send you a TestFlight invite immediately. 😊

## 🚀 What’s Next

With a hard deadline in sight, we’re focused on adding those final touches to the game. We’re also building out the concept of theming levels into the gameplay to ensure a smooth experience for launch day. I am also trying to get in the Apple Small Business program to reduce the percentage of commission that they charge.

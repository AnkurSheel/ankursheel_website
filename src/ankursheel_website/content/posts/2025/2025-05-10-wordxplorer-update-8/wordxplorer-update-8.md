## New Hint System

We're excited to introduce our new hint system! This feature helps players when they're stuck, making the game more accessible while still maintaining the challenge.

The hint system provides contextual clues about the word. 

Here's how the hints look when locked and unlocked:

| The hint popup at the start of the game, showing all hints are locked | The hint popup after 2 hints have been unlocked, showing the available clues |

And here's how it works in action:

These clues help kids think about the word in a different way, making the game both educational and fun. They can use them strategically to learn and improve their word-solving skills.

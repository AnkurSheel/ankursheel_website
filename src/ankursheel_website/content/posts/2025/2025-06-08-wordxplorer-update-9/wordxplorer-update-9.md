## Save your guesses
  
Your guesses are now saved, letting you take as long as you need to solve each level without starting over. 

When you return to a level, youâ€™ll see all your previous guesses, allowing you to continue right where you left off. Once you successfully complete a level, all your guesses for that puzzle will be cleared, giving you a fresh start when you decide to replay it.
  
Here's how it works in action:

## Bug Fixes

- I've resolved the issue where the keyboard colour changed to white after moving to the next level.
- I've also fixed the problem where the latest level showed up as locked when you went back to the level selection screen after finishing a level.

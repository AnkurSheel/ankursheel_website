Every week I come across some great articles. Here are some of the posts I feel you will enjoy reading as much as I did.

**Sebastian Scholl** has a really [entertaining article](https://css-tricks.com/meeting-graphql-at-a-cocktail-mixer/) over at **CSS-Tricks** to explain the difference between REST and GraphQL by using an example of how they would respond if you met them at a cocktail mixer.

If you are wondering how to [move away from React classes to React hooks](https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-hooks), **Amelia Wattenberger** has got you covered by explaining the mindset change that you need to make.

**Ruth** from the **The Happy Saver** talks about why [she doesn't want to own a rental property](https://www.thehappysaver.com/blog/no-i-dont-want-a-rental-property-thank-you). This one resonated with me quite a bit as I am on the fence of even [buying a house](/blog/rent-buy-house).

Have you tried [finding a mentor and found it hard to find one](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/hard-to-find-mentor-coach/)? **Ramit Sethi** from **Ramit Sethi** explains why you should start by asking the question "AM I THE RIGHT STUDENT?" and how you can be a great one before looking for a mentor.

Have you ever wondered as to how we have reached where we are as a society? **Tim Urban** at **Wait But Why** has a great series about [society and the Story of Us](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html).

Hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I did.

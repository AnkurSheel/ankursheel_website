Adding CI/CD to Unity projects is a game-changer, even if you're not a CI/CD enthusiast.

In this series, I'll guide you through setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline for Unity projects using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [GameCI](https://game.ci/).

Part 1 of this series covers the essential one-time setup for a successful CI/CD pipeline.

**_Note: These setup steps can be skipped if you've already performed them for a previous project._**

## Acquire an Activation File for GitHub Runners

_**Note: The activation file uses machine identifiers, so we need to generate a license for GitHub runners.**_

1. Create a file named `.github/workflows/activation.yml` and add the following workflow definition:

```yaml
name: Acquire activation file  
on:  
  workflow_dispatch: {}  
jobs:  
  activation:  
    name: Request manual activation file ðŸ”‘  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
      # Request manual activation file  
      - name: Unity - Request Activation File  
        id: getManualLicenseFile  
        uses: game-ci/unity-request-activation-file@v2.0.0  
      # Upload artifact (Unity_v20XX.X.XXXX.alf)  
      - name: Expose as artifact  
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:  
          name: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}  
          path: ${{ steps.getManualLicenseFile.outputs.filePath }}
```

In this workflow, we use GameCI to request the activation file and upload it as an artifact. The **workflow_dispatch** event enables manual triggering of this workflow.

2. Manually run the above workflow  
   ![Run workflow manually](./run-workflow.png)

3. Download the manual activation file that appears as an artifact and extract the .alf file from the zip  
   ![Download Artifact](./download-artifact.png)

4. Visit [license.unity3d.com](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) and upload the _alf_ file.  
   ![Upload Alf file.png](./upload-alf.png)

_Note: If you do not see the option for activating a "Unity Personal license", follow the steps at [Workaround for Unity Personal License Manual Activation Not Supported](./unity-personal-license-manual-activation-workaround)_.

5. Download the _ulf_ file. _The numbers don't have to match the Unity version exactly._

## Install Ruby

- Install Ruby from [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
- Verify the installation by running `ruby -v`.
- Install _Bundler_ by running `gem install bundler`

## Setup Codesigning with GitHub Actions

- Create a private GitHub repository to store the certificates and code-signing identities we generate.
- In the private repository, navigate to _Settings_ -> _Deploy Keys_ -> _Add Deploy Key_
  ![Add a new deploy key](./deploy_key.png)
- Generate an SSH key. We can use 1Password or use `ssh-keygen` utility.
- Paste the public key (starting with ssh) into the "Key" field.
- elect **_Allow write access_** to enable pushing certificates to the repository.
  ![Add key](./add_key.png)

### Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token

We need a Personal Access Token to enable our Github Actions to access the private GitHub repository where we'll store our certificates.

- Go to _Settings_ -> _Developer Settings_ -> _Personal Access Tokens_ -> _Tokens (classic)_.
- Click _Generate Token_.

![Generate Personal Access Token](./generate_personal_access_token.png)

- Give the token all **_repo_** permissions.

## Setting up Secrets for GitHub Actions

On GitHub, navigate to _Settings_ -> _Secrets and Variables_ -> _Actions_.

![Adding secrets](./adding_secrets.png)

Create the following secrets

- **UNITY_EMAIL**: Your Unity login email address.
- **UNITY_LICENSE**: The contents of the .ulf file.
- **UNITY_PASSWORD**: Your Unity login password.
- **GH_PAT**: The Personal Access Token we generated.
- **MATCH_PASSWORD**: This is an additional layer of security required for encrypting/decrypting certificates.
- **MATCH_REPOSITORY**: The name of the private GitHub repository that will store our certificates, in the format `organization/repository`.
- **MATCH_DEPLOY_KEY**: This is the private part of the SSH key we created in the private repository to store our certificates.
- **APPLE_CONNECT_EMAIL**: Your Apple ID email.
- **APPLE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL**: Your Apple ID email.
- **APPLE_TEAM_ID**: Team Id from your [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account) -> _Membership Details_.

I recommend adding these secrets at the organization level so you can reuse them across multiple projects. You can then selectively grant access to each secret for specific repositories.

## Conclusion

This one-time setup paves the way for a streamlined Unity CI/CD pipeline. Stay tuned for the next steps in our journey. Happy coding!!

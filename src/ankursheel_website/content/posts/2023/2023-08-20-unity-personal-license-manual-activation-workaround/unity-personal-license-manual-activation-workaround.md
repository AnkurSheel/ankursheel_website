You decided to add a CI/CD pipeline to your Unity Project using [GameCI](https://game.ci/). You are all pumped up and
ready to start.

What's the 1st step? Activating Unity! No biggie, right?

Well, hold on a sec. You generate the **_alf_** file after creating the github action. You carry on with the list and
head to https://license.unity3d.com/manual, all set to create that **_ulf_** file.

## Plot Twist

But hold your horses because here comes the twist.

![Unity no longer supports manual activation of Personal licenses](./no_longer_supported.png)

Unity dropped a bombshell: "Unity no longer supports manual activation of Personal licenses."

Manual activation of Personal licenses? Nope, not happening anymore. Cue the dramatic music. ðŸŽµ

But we are not giving up that easily. We disregard the message and upload the **_alf_** file.

Something's fishy. The option to generate an ulf for a personal license? Poof, it's vanished. Instead, it asks us to
type in a serial number.

## Time for a bit of trickery

Right-click and inspect the serial number box

Now, hunt down the `<div class="option option-personal clear" style="display: none;">` section

Guess what? We're deleting that pesky `"display: none;"`.

Boom! Like magic, the Unity Personal Edition option reappears. ðŸŽ‰

Hopefully, before this hack stops working, GameCI will have an official workaround :)

### Shoutout

And here's a shoutout to [realpepe](https://reallpepe.itch.io/defendron), who cracked the code and shared the wisdom on
Discord. Because in the world of tech, teamwork makes the magic happen.

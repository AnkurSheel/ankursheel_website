When it comes to professional growth, one question often looms large

> What should I discuss in my 1:1 meetings? I often have nothing beyond project updates.

This is a common concern, and it's crucial to recognise that a 1:1 meeting is more than just a status update session. It's an opportunity to connect with your manager, discuss your progress, and express your thoughts and concerns.

## How to Effectively Prepare for a 1:1

Preparation is key to making the most of your 1:1 meetings. Not only does it demonstrate professionalism, but it also maximises the value of your time.

Taking notes during(or just after) the 1:1 is pivotal for several reasons. It demonstrates active engagement, aids in retaining essential points, and serves as a reference for future discussions. You can easily look at your notes and if for example, you havent spoken about professional growth for a while, you can focus on those questions in the next 1:1.

I like to have at least 3-5 prepared topics using the questions below as prompts.

### Review Previous Meeting

- Have I made any progress on the action items from the last 1:1?
- Are there any action items from the last 1:1 that I need to follow up with my supervisor?

### Brief Project Updates

_Limit project updates to 1 or 2 minutes unless it's the primary focus. Remember, 1:1s aren't project status meetings._

- Is the project status on or off track?
- Are there any noteworthy highlights or progress updates (that were not already covered in standups or elsewhere)?

### Share Wins

- What were my key achievements since the last 1:1? *Highlight accomplishments that have moved me or the team forward.*
- What went exceptionally well?

### Identify Challenges

- Are there any decisions I can't make independently and require input?
- Are there current issues I want to see resolved in the coming months?
- Are there any interpersonal tensions with colleagues that I would like to address proactively?
- Are there aspects of team dynamics that concern me?
- What could have gone better?

### Discuss Career Growth and Professional Development

- Share any feedback I have received from colleagues or clients.
- Are there any opportunities I am interested in?
- Am I happy with my current project?
- Do I feel like I’m learning? Are there things I feel like I’m not learning that I would like to?
- Request feedback on recent projects or tasks and inquire about areas for improvement. (*Note: It's often better to ask for feedback immediately after an event, as waiting until the 1:1 might be too late.)*
- Explore which skills I should focus on developing for my current role and future roles.
- Ask what I could do differently or what behaviours my supervisor doesn't appreciate.
- Inquire about anything I should start doing or stop doing.

### Flip the Conversation

- Find out my supervisor's top priorities.
- Ask about any concerns or worries regarding the team.
- Explore how I can better support my supervisor.

### Backup Questions

*Use this section only when there's nothing else to discuss, and there's time.*

- Share any interesting updates, lessons, or personal achievements.

## Share Your 1:1 Experiences and Tips

Navigating 1:1 meetings might seem daunting initially, but effective preparation, thoughtful questions, and diligent follow-ups can help make it easier. Remember, there's no such thing as a perfect 1:1 meeting.

We're all on a learning journey, and your experiences and tips are invaluable. Have you discovered other effective ways to prepare for 1:1s? Are there additional questions that have proven helpful for you? How do you ensure you follow up on action items?

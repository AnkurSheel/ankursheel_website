At the start of the quarter, I laid out some high-level personal goals. Here’s how I did against those goals.

#### Goal: Publish 3 blog posts

**Result**: I published 4 posts

**How it went**: <span style="color: green;">SUCCESS</span>

I published 4 posts.

- [Workaround for Unity Personal License Manual Activation Not Supported](./unity-personal-license-manual-activation-workaround)
- [Cleaning Up Unnecessary Remote-Tracking References](./cleaning-up-unnecessary-remote-tracking-references)
- [Unlock your career's potential with effective 1:1 meetings](./unlock-your-careers-potential-effective-11-meetings)
- [Unity CI/CD Demystified: Part 1: One-Time Setup](./unity-cicd-one-time-setup)

I also refreshed an old post

- [Should I Rent Or Buy a House?](./rent-buy-house)

### Goal: Publish 3 book summaries

**Result**: I didnt finish even a single book summary

**How it went**: <span style="color: red;">FAILURE</span>

I need to take out time to write a book summary a month. Maybe I should have spent some time on book summaries instead of the 4th post.

### Goal: Explore ideas for a new game

**Result**: I settled on creating a Wordle for Kids and reached out to a few people to gauge interest.

**How it went**: <span style="color: orange;">MEH</span>

I created a MVP for a 4 letter wordle clone. I shared a [form](https://tally.so/r/wverVQ) on social media to gauge interest for a Wordle for Kids game. Although, I did not get as many responses as I would have liked, it was enough to validate that people are interested in having an app that has kid appropriate 4 letter words.

## Goals for next month

- Publish 3 blog posts on ankursheel.com
- Publish 3 book summaries on discoveriesinbookland.com
- Get WordWhiz in the hands of beta testers and get the 1st release out
- Get 10 more responses to the WordWhiz form
- Lose 5 kgs
- 25 consecutive pushups
- 50 consecutive squats

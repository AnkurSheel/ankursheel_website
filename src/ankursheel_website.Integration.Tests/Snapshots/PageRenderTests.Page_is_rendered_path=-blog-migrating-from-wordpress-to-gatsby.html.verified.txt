<html><head></head><body><h2 id="my-blogging-journey">My Blogging Journey</h2>
<p>I started blogging in 2008 with a free Blogspot account. If you are wondering what I am talking about, Blogspot was the free blogging platform provided by Google.</p>
<p>But it was not until 2014 that I decided to get my domain and have more control over the content and structure of the blog. Enter self-hosting. At that time, WordPress was probably the most popular service, and I moved to a self-hosted blog leveraging all the power of WordPress.</p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-moving-away-from-wordpress">Reasons for moving away from WordPress</h2>
<p>There were a few reasons that the WordPress solution was not working for me anymore. In no particular order,</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow
<ul>
<li>Let's face it, shared hosting does not make for a fast site. Also, WordPress is itself sluggish, and the various plugins I had added were not helping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cost
<ul>
<li>Most hosting platforms have a heavily discounted first-year plan, after which the price rises astronomically. This resulted in me having to migrate my site every year to a new platform. A few providers made it difficult to cancel the plan and get back the data unless you did it a month in advance. It was getting harder to justify the expense of 100+ USD. Even the cheapest option would easily set me back by 50-60 USD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Degraded Experience in writing posts
<ul>
<li>With the release of the new generation editor and having to do everything with content blocks, I felt like I was spending more time than I felt was required to create a new post.</li>
<li>I did not want to log in to the site every time I wanted to create a new post or work on an existing draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Programming Language that I don't use anywhere else
<ul>
<li>I never enjoyed the process of writing PHP to make modifications. The few custom modifications that I made on the site felt like a chore. The fact that I could never see myself using PHP anywhere else probably did not help either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-gatsby">Why Gatsby</h2>
<p>Recently, it has become easier to have a relatively cheap solution for hosting static content by using a static site generator. There are quite a few options out there.</p>
<p>The first that comes to mind is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>, which comes nicely integrated with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is a static website generator. Although it ticked 3 of the 4 boxes above, I did not feel it was the ideal solution for me mainly because the development language was Ruby, another language I couldn't see myself using anywhere else.</p>
<p>It was a similar story with Hugo, which uses Go.</p>
<p>Just when it seemed that I would have to resign myself to use Github Pages, I found out about <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, which is based on Javascript. I have been using Typescript increasingly at work, so this seemed like the perfect solution.</p>
<p>Let's see how it stacks up against my concerns from the previous section.</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Slow</del>
<ul>
<li>Gatsby sites are fast. Blazingly fast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><del>Cost</del> Netlify is awesome.- It's free to host it on <a href="http://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. You can't beat free. It requires almost no setup, and every time I push to master, a new version of the site is deployed.</li>
<li><del>Degraded Experience of writing posts</del>
<ul>
<li>It supports markdown and MDX, which means I can write and edit the posts in any text editor and anywhere. I can also embed react components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><del>Programming Language that I don't use anywhere else</del>
<ul>
<li>It's built on the <strong>JAM</strong>stack (<strong>J</strong>avascript <strong>A</strong>PI <strong>M</strong>arkup). All the custom tooling I want to do uses ReactJS, GraphQL, JavaScript/Typescript and CSS. I am using all of these at work, so I can easily transfer the learnings from one place to another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-advantages">Other Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build reusable components and use them to construct views.</li>
<li>Hot Reloading and code-splitting are built-in.</li>
<li>Can easily be configured to use Typescript.</li>
<li>A bunch of plugins and starters (both official and unofficial).</li>
<li>Support for CSS-in-JS.</li>
<li>Responsive and optimized images.</li>
<li>No reloads between pages.</li>
<li>Gatsby detects what links are on the page and prefetches the content.</li>
<li>Support for MDX which means I can embed React components into the posts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-migration-process">My migration process</h2>
<p>It's also not difficult to move your blog from WordPress to Gatsby. I will give you the basics of what I did if you also want to make the switch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the XML from Wordpress using the "Tools-&gt; Export" section.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">ExitWP</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">Wordpress-to-Hugo</a> tool to convert the posts to markdown.</li>
<li>Download all the images and other content from the server.</li>
<li>Find a Gatsby start starter so that it's easy to get started.</li>
<li>Add Git LFS as some of my posts are image-heavy.</li>
<li>Connect to Netlify and set up automatic deploys.</li>
<li>The one I used was written in Javascript, so I had to migrate the javascript to Typescript and a few more plugins to enable Typescript. Also, change styling options to use CSS-in-JS.</li>
<li>Update styling, colours and layout.</li>
<li>Update the starter so that all the blog content is under "/blog/".</li>
<li>Add a redirect rule as I decided to remove the date from the URLs.</li>
<li>Add the converted markdown.
<ul>
<li>Fix indent and other issues.</li>
<li>Build missing react components depending on the post content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="you-said-it-was-easy-to-move-from-wordpress-to-gatsby.but-i-dont-see-all-of-your-posts.did-you-lie">You said it was easy to move from WordPress to gatsby. But I don't see all of your posts. Did you lie?</h2>
<p>Depending on when you read this post, you might notice that many posts seem to be missing. At the very least, it doesn't seem as if I have been blogging for so many years. The main reason for this is that the original blog had a lot of varied content.</p>
<p>I have decided to move some of it away to a different blog. For example, I am moving the book reviews to <a href="https://www.discoveriesinbookland.com/">Discoveries in Bookland</a>. Some of it might not even make it to this blog because of the limited value it adds.</p>
<p>I have taken this opportunity to revisit what content I want to show.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although it's an ongoing process, I am happy with how the migration is progressing. <a href="https://www.ankursheel.com/">my blog</a> is now built with React, Node.js, Gatsby, Markdown and hosted on Netlify. I still have control over my content and blog structure. All the posts are in version control, so there is no need for tons of backups.</p>
<p>I will be adding more posts related to things I had to go hunting for on google. If you would like to know more about something specific, let me know.</p>
